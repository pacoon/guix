8.8.24 Virtualization services
------------------------------

The ‘(gnu services virtualization)’ module provides services for the
libvirt and virtlog daemons, as well as other virtualization-related
services.

Libvirt daemon
..............

‘libvirtd’ is the server side daemon component of the libvirt
virtualization management system.  This daemon runs on host servers and
performs required management tasks for virtualized guests.

 -- Scheme Variable: libvirt-service-type
     This is the type of the libvirt daemon (https://libvirt.org).  Its
     value must be a ‘libvirt-configuration’.

          (service libvirt-service-type
                   (libvirt-configuration
                    (unix-sock-group "libvirt")
                    (tls-port "16555")))

   Available ‘libvirt-configuration’ fields are:

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: package libvirt
     Libvirt package.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: boolean listen-tls?
     Flag listening for secure TLS connections on the public TCP/IP
     port.  must set ‘listen’ for this to have any effect.

     It is necessary to setup a CA and issue server certificates before
     using this capability.

     Defaults to ‘#t’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: boolean listen-tcp?
     Listen for unencrypted TCP connections on the public TCP/IP port.
     must set ‘listen’ for this to have any effect.

     Using the TCP socket requires SASL authentication by default.  Only
     SASL mechanisms which support data encryption are allowed.  This is
     DIGEST_MD5 and GSSAPI (Kerberos5)

     Defaults to ‘#f’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string tls-port
     Port for accepting secure TLS connections This can be a port
     number, or service name

     Defaults to ‘"16514"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string tcp-port
     Port for accepting insecure TCP connections This can be a port
     number, or service name

     Defaults to ‘"16509"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string listen-addr
     IP address or hostname used for client connections.

     Defaults to ‘"0.0.0.0"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: boolean mdns-adv?
     Flag toggling mDNS advertisement of the libvirt service.

     Alternatively can disable for all services on a host by stopping
     the Avahi daemon.

     Defaults to ‘#f’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string mdns-name
     Default mDNS advertisement name.  This must be unique on the
     immediate broadcast network.

     Defaults to ‘"Virtualization Host <hostname>"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string unix-sock-group
     UNIX domain socket group ownership.  This can be used to allow a
     ’trusted’ set of users access to management capabilities without
     becoming root.

     Defaults to ‘"root"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string unix-sock-ro-perms
     UNIX socket permissions for the R/O socket.  This is used for
     monitoring VM status only.

     Defaults to ‘"0777"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string unix-sock-rw-perms
     UNIX socket permissions for the R/W socket.  Default allows only
     root.  If PolicyKit is enabled on the socket, the default will
     change to allow everyone (eg, 0777)

     Defaults to ‘"0770"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string unix-sock-admin-perms
     UNIX socket permissions for the admin socket.  Default allows only
     owner (root), do not change it unless you are sure to whom you are
     exposing the access to.

     Defaults to ‘"0777"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string unix-sock-dir
     The directory in which sockets will be found/created.

     Defaults to ‘"/var/run/libvirt"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string auth-unix-ro
     Authentication scheme for UNIX read-only sockets.  By default
     socket permissions allow anyone to connect

     Defaults to ‘"polkit"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string auth-unix-rw
     Authentication scheme for UNIX read-write sockets.  By default
     socket permissions only allow root.  If PolicyKit support was
     compiled into libvirt, the default will be to use ’polkit’ auth.

     Defaults to ‘"polkit"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string auth-tcp
     Authentication scheme for TCP sockets.  If you don’t enable SASL,
     then all TCP traffic is cleartext.  Don’t do this outside of a
     dev/test scenario.

     Defaults to ‘"sasl"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string auth-tls
     Authentication scheme for TLS sockets.  TLS sockets already have
     encryption provided by the TLS layer, and limited authentication is
     done by certificates.

     It is possible to make use of any SASL authentication mechanism as
     well, by using ’sasl’ for this option

     Defaults to ‘"none"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: optional-list access-drivers
     API access control scheme.

     By default an authenticated user is allowed access to all APIs.
     Access drivers can place restrictions on this.

     Defaults to ‘()’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string key-file
     Server key file path.  If set to an empty string, then no private
     key is loaded.

     Defaults to ‘""’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string cert-file
     Server key file path.  If set to an empty string, then no
     certificate is loaded.

     Defaults to ‘""’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string ca-file
     Server key file path.  If set to an empty string, then no CA
     certificate is loaded.

     Defaults to ‘""’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string crl-file
     Certificate revocation list path.  If set to an empty string, then
     no CRL is loaded.

     Defaults to ‘""’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: boolean tls-no-sanity-cert
     Disable verification of our own server certificates.

     When libvirtd starts it performs some sanity checks against its own
     certificates.

     Defaults to ‘#f’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: boolean tls-no-verify-cert
     Disable verification of client certificates.

     Client certificate verification is the primary authentication
     mechanism.  Any client which does not present a certificate signed
     by the CA will be rejected.

     Defaults to ‘#f’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: optional-list tls-allowed-dn-list
     Whitelist of allowed x509 Distinguished Name.

     Defaults to ‘()’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: optional-list
          sasl-allowed-usernames
     Whitelist of allowed SASL usernames.  The format for username
     depends on the SASL authentication mechanism.

     Defaults to ‘()’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string tls-priority
     Override the compile time default TLS priority string.  The default
     is usually ‘"NORMAL"’ unless overridden at build time.  Only set
     this is it is desired for libvirt to deviate from the global
     default settings.

     Defaults to ‘"NORMAL"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer max-clients
     Maximum number of concurrent client connections to allow over all
     sockets combined.

     Defaults to ‘5000’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer max-queued-clients
     Maximum length of queue of connections waiting to be accepted by
     the daemon.  Note, that some protocols supporting retransmission
     may obey this so that a later reattempt at connection succeeds.

     Defaults to ‘1000’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer max-anonymous-clients
     Maximum length of queue of accepted but not yet authenticated
     clients.  Set this to zero to turn this feature off

     Defaults to ‘20’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer min-workers
     Number of workers to start up initially.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer max-workers
     Maximum number of worker threads.

     If the number of active clients exceeds ‘min-workers’, then more
     threads are spawned, up to max_workers limit.  Typically you’d want
     max_workers to equal maximum number of clients allowed.

     Defaults to ‘20’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer prio-workers
     Number of priority workers.  If all workers from above pool are
     stuck, some calls marked as high priority (notably domainDestroy)
     can be executed in this pool.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer max-requests
     Total global limit on concurrent RPC calls.

     Defaults to ‘20’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer max-client-requests
     Limit on concurrent requests from a single client connection.  To
     avoid one client monopolizing the server this should be a small
     fraction of the global max_requests and max_workers parameter.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer admin-min-workers
     Same as ‘min-workers’ but for the admin interface.

     Defaults to ‘1’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer admin-max-workers
     Same as ‘max-workers’ but for the admin interface.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer admin-max-clients
     Same as ‘max-clients’ but for the admin interface.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer admin-max-queued-clients
     Same as ‘max-queued-clients’ but for the admin interface.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer admin-max-client-requests
     Same as ‘max-client-requests’ but for the admin interface.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer log-level
     Logging level.  4 errors, 3 warnings, 2 information, 1 debug.

     Defaults to ‘3’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string log-filters
     Logging filters.

     A filter allows to select a different logging level for a given
     category of logs The format for a filter is one of:

        • x:name

        • x:+name

     where ‘name’ is a string which is matched against the category
     given in the ‘VIR_LOG_INIT()’ at the top of each libvirt source
     file, e.g., ‘"remote"’, ‘"qemu"’, or ‘"util.json"’ (the name in the
     filter can be a substring of the full category name, in order to
     match multiple similar categories), the optional ‘"+"’ prefix tells
     libvirt to log stack trace for each message matching name, and ‘x’
     is the minimal level where matching messages should be logged:

        • 1: DEBUG

        • 2: INFO

        • 3: WARNING

        • 4: ERROR

     Multiple filters can be defined in a single filters statement, they
     just need to be separated by spaces.

     Defaults to ‘"3:remote 4:event"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string log-outputs
     Logging outputs.

     An output is one of the places to save logging information.  The
     format for an output can be:

     ‘x:stderr’
          output goes to stderr

     ‘x:syslog:name’
          use syslog for the output and use the given name as the ident

     ‘x:file:file_path’
          output to a file, with the given filepath

     ‘x:journald’
          output to journald logging system

     In all case the x prefix is the minimal level, acting as a filter

        • 1: DEBUG

        • 2: INFO

        • 3: WARNING

        • 4: ERROR

     Multiple outputs can be defined, they just need to be separated by
     spaces.

     Defaults to ‘"3:stderr"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer audit-level
     Allows usage of the auditing subsystem to be altered

        • 0: disable all auditing

        • 1: enable auditing, only if enabled on host

        • 2: enable auditing, and exit if disabled on host.

     Defaults to ‘1’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: boolean audit-logging
     Send audit messages via libvirt logging infrastructure.

     Defaults to ‘#f’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: optional-string host-uuid
     Host UUID. UUID must not have all digits be the same.

     Defaults to ‘""’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: string host-uuid-source
     Source to read host UUID.

        • ‘smbios’: fetch the UUID from ‘dmidecode -s system-uuid’

        • ‘machine-id’: fetch the UUID from ‘/etc/machine-id’

     If ‘dmidecode’ does not provide a valid UUID a temporary UUID will
     be generated.

     Defaults to ‘"smbios"’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer keepalive-interval
     A keepalive message is sent to a client after ‘keepalive_interval’
     seconds of inactivity to check if the client is still responding.
     If set to -1, libvirtd will never send keepalive requests; however
     clients can still send them and the daemon will send responses.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer keepalive-count
     Maximum number of keepalive messages that are allowed to be sent to
     the client without getting any response before the connection is
     considered broken.

     In other words, the connection is automatically closed
     approximately after ‘keepalive_interval * (keepalive_count + 1)’
     seconds since the last message received from the client.  When
     ‘keepalive-count’ is set to 0, connections will be automatically
     closed after ‘keepalive-interval’ seconds of inactivity without
     sending any keepalive messages.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer admin-keepalive-interval
     Same as above but for admin interface.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer admin-keepalive-count
     Same as above but for admin interface.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

 -- ‘libvirt-configuration’ parameter: integer ovs-timeout
     Timeout for Open vSwitch calls.

     The ‘ovs-vsctl’ utility is used for the configuration and its
     timeout option is set by default to 5 seconds to avoid potential
     infinite waits blocking libvirt.

     Defaults to ‘5’.

Virtlog daemon
..............

The virtlogd service is a server side daemon component of libvirt that
is used to manage logs from virtual machine consoles.

   This daemon is not used directly by libvirt client applications,
rather it is called on their behalf by ‘libvirtd’.  By maintaining the
logs in a standalone daemon, the main ‘libvirtd’ daemon can be restarted
without risk of losing logs.  The ‘virtlogd’ daemon has the ability to
re-exec() itself upon receiving ‘SIGUSR1’, to allow live upgrades
without downtime.

 -- Scheme Variable: virtlog-service-type
     This is the type of the virtlog daemon.  Its value must be a
     ‘virtlog-configuration’.

          (service virtlog-service-type
                   (virtlog-configuration
                    (max-clients 1000)))

 -- ‘virtlog-configuration’ parameter: integer log-level
     Logging level.  4 errors, 3 warnings, 2 information, 1 debug.

     Defaults to ‘3’.

 -- ‘virtlog-configuration’ parameter: string log-filters
     Logging filters.

     A filter allows to select a different logging level for a given
     category of logs The format for a filter is one of:

        • x:name

        • x:+name

     where ‘name’ is a string which is matched against the category
     given in the ‘VIR_LOG_INIT()’ at the top of each libvirt source
     file, e.g., "remote", "qemu", or "util.json" (the name in the
     filter can be a substring of the full category name, in order to
     match multiple similar categories), the optional "+" prefix tells
     libvirt to log stack trace for each message matching name, and ‘x’
     is the minimal level where matching messages should be logged:

        • 1: DEBUG

        • 2: INFO

        • 3: WARNING

        • 4: ERROR

     Multiple filters can be defined in a single filters statement, they
     just need to be separated by spaces.

     Defaults to ‘"3:remote 4:event"’.

 -- ‘virtlog-configuration’ parameter: string log-outputs
     Logging outputs.

     An output is one of the places to save logging information The
     format for an output can be:

     ‘x:stderr’
          output goes to stderr

     ‘x:syslog:name’
          use syslog for the output and use the given name as the ident

     ‘x:file:file_path’
          output to a file, with the given filepath

     ‘x:journald’
          output to journald logging system

     In all case the x prefix is the minimal level, acting as a filter

        • 1: DEBUG

        • 2: INFO

        • 3: WARNING

        • 4: ERROR

     Multiple outputs can be defined, they just need to be separated by
     spaces.

     Defaults to ‘"3:stderr"’.

 -- ‘virtlog-configuration’ parameter: integer max-clients
     Maximum number of concurrent client connections to allow over all
     sockets combined.

     Defaults to ‘1024’.

 -- ‘virtlog-configuration’ parameter: integer max-size
     Maximum file size before rolling over.

     Defaults to ‘2MB’

 -- ‘virtlog-configuration’ parameter: integer max-backups
     Maximum number of backup files to keep.

     Defaults to ‘3’

Transparent Emulation with QEMU
...............................

‘qemu-binfmt-service-type’ provides support for transparent emulation of
program binaries built for different architectures—e.g., it allows you
to transparently execute an ARMv7 program on an x86_64 machine.  It
achieves this by combining the QEMU (https://www.qemu.org) emulator and
the ‘binfmt_misc’ feature of the kernel Linux.

 -- Scheme Variable: qemu-binfmt-service-type
     This is the type of the QEMU/binfmt service for transparent
     emulation.  Its value must be a ‘qemu-binfmt-configuration’ object,
     which specifies the QEMU package to use as well as the architecture
     we want to emulated:

          (service qemu-binfmt-service-type
                   (qemu-binfmt-configuration
                     (platforms (lookup-qemu-platforms "arm" "aarch64"))))

     In this example, we enable transparent emulation for the ARM and
     aarch64 platforms.  Running ‘herd stop qemu-binfmt’ turns it off,
     and running ‘herd start qemu-binfmt’ turns it back on (*note the
     ‘herd’ command: (shepherd)Invoking herd.).

 -- Data Type: qemu-binfmt-configuration
     This is the configuration for the ‘qemu-binfmt’ service.

     ‘platforms’ (default: ‘'()’)
          The list of emulated QEMU platforms.  Each item must be a
          “platform object” as returned by ‘lookup-qemu-platforms’ (see
          below).

     ‘guix-support?’ (default: ‘#f’)
          When it is true, QEMU and all its dependencies are added to
          the build environment of ‘guix-daemon’ (*note
          ‘--chroot-directory’ option: 调用guix-daemon.).  This allows
          the ‘binfmt_misc’ handlers to be used within the build
          environment, which in turn means that you can transparently
          build programs for another architecture.

          For example, let’s suppose you’re on an x86_64 machine and you
          have this service:

               (service qemu-binfmt-service-type
                        (qemu-binfmt-configuration
                          (platforms (lookup-qemu-platforms "arm"))
                          (guix-support? #t)))

          You can run:

               guix build -s armhf-linux inkscape

          and it will build Inkscape for ARMv7 _as if it were a native
          build_, transparently using QEMU to emulate the ARMv7 CPU.
          Pretty handy if you’d like to test a package build for an
          architecture you don’t have access to!

     ‘qemu’ (default: ‘qemu’)

8.8.25 版本控制服务
-------------------

The ‘(gnu services version-control)’ module provides a service to allow
remote access to local Git repositories.  There are three options: the
‘git-daemon-service’, which provides access to repositories via the
‘git://’ unsecured TCP-based protocol, extending the ‘nginx’ web server
to proxy some requests to ‘git-http-backend’, or providing a web
interface with ‘cgit-service-type’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: git-daemon-service [#:config
          (git-daemon-configuration)]

     Return a service that runs ‘git daemon’, a simple TCP server to
     expose repositories over the Git protocol for anonymous access.

     The optional CONFIG argument should be a
     ‘<git-daemon-configuration>’ object, by default it allows read-only
     access to exported(1) repositories under ‘/srv/git’.

 -- Data Type: git-daemon-configuration
     Data type representing the configuration for ‘git-daemon-service’.

     ‘package’ (default: GIT)
          Package object of the Git distributed version control system.

     ‘export-all?’ (default: #F)
          Whether to allow access for all Git repositories, even if they
          do not have the ‘git-daemon-export-ok’ file.

     ‘base-path’ (default: ‘/srv/git’)
          Whether to remap all the path requests as relative to the
          given path.  If you run git daemon with (BASE-PATH "/SRV/GIT")
          on example.com, then if you later try to pull
          ‘git://example.com/hello.git’, git daemon will interpret the
          path as ‘/srv/git/hello.git’.

     ‘user-path’ (default: #F)
          Whether to allow ‘~user’ notation to be used in requests.
          When specified with empty string, requests to
          ‘git://host/~alice/foo’ is taken as a request to access ‘foo’
          repository in the home directory of user ‘alice’.  If
          (USER-PATH "PATH") is specified, the same request is taken as
          a request to access ‘path/foo’ repository in the home
          directory of user ‘alice’.

     ‘listen’ (default: ’())
          Whether to listen on specific IP addresses or hostnames,
          defaults to all.

     ‘port’ (default: #F)
          Whether to listen on an alternative port, which defaults to
          9418.

     ‘whitelist’ (default: ’())
          If not empty, only allow access to this list of directories.

     ‘extra-options’ (default: ’())
          Extra options will be passed to ‘git daemon’, please run ‘man
          git-daemon’ for more information.

   The ‘git://’ protocol lacks authentication.  When you pull from a
repository fetched via ‘git://’, you don’t know whether the data you
receive was modified or is even coming from the specified host, and your
connection is subject to eavesdropping.  It’s better to use an
authenticated and encrypted transport, such as ‘https’.  Although Git
allows you to serve repositories using unsophisticated file-based web
servers, there is a faster protocol implemented by the
‘git-http-backend’ program.  This program is the back-end of a proper
Git web service.  It is designed to sit behind a FastCGI proxy.  *Note
Web服务::, for more on running the necessary ‘fcgiwrap’ daemon.

   Guix has a separate configuration data type for serving Git
repositories over HTTP.

 -- Data Type: git-http-configuration
     Data type representing the configuration for a future
     ‘git-http-service-type’; can currently be used to configure Nginx
     trough ‘git-http-nginx-location-configuration’.

     ‘package’ (default: GIT)
          Package object of the Git distributed version control system.

     ‘git-root’ (default: ‘/srv/git’)
          Directory containing the Git repositories to expose to the
          world.

     ‘export-all?’ (default: #F)
          Whether to expose access for all Git repositories in GIT-ROOT,
          even if they do not have the ‘git-daemon-export-ok’ file.

     ‘uri-path’ (default: ‘/git/’)
          Path prefix for Git access.  With the default ‘/git/’ prefix,
          this will map ‘http://SERVER/git/REPO.git’ to
          ‘/srv/git/REPO.git’.  Requests whose URI paths do not begin
          with this prefix are not passed on to this Git instance.

     ‘fcgiwrap-socket’ (default: ‘127.0.0.1:9000’)
          The socket on which the ‘fcgiwrap’ daemon is listening.  *Note
          Web服务::.

   There is no ‘git-http-service-type’, currently; instead you can
create an ‘nginx-location-configuration’ from a ‘git-http-configuration’
and then add that location to a web server.

 -- Scheme Procedure: git-http-nginx-location-configuration
          [config=(git-http-configuration)] Compute an
     ‘nginx-location-configuration’ that corresponds to the given Git
     http configuration.  An example nginx service definition to serve
     the default ‘/srv/git’ over HTTPS might be:

          (service nginx-service-type
                   (nginx-configuration
                    (server-blocks
                     (list
                      (nginx-server-configuration
                       (listen '("443 ssl"))
                       (server-name "git.my-host.org")
                       (ssl-certificate
                        "/etc/letsencrypt/live/git.my-host.org/fullchain.pem")
                       (ssl-certificate-key
                        "/etc/letsencrypt/live/git.my-host.org/privkey.pem")
                       (locations
                        (list
                         (git-http-nginx-location-configuration
                          (git-http-configuration (uri-path "/"))))))))))

     This example assumes that you are using Let’s Encrypt to get your
     TLS certificate.  *Note 证书服务::.  The default ‘certbot’ service
     will redirect all HTTP traffic on ‘git.my-host.org’ to HTTPS. You
     will also need to add an ‘fcgiwrap’ proxy to your system services.
     *Note Web服务::.

      -- ‘repository-cgit-configuration’ parameter: repo-string name
          The value to show as repository name.

          Defaults to ‘""’.

      -- ‘repository-cgit-configuration’ parameter: repo-string owner
          A value used to identify the owner of the repository.

          Defaults to ‘""’.

 -- ‘cgit-configuration’ parameter: list extra-options
     Extra options will be appended to cgitrc file.

     Defaults to ‘()’.

   However, it could be that you just want to get a ‘cgitrc’ up and
running.  In that case, you can pass an ‘opaque-cgit-configuration’ as a
record to ‘cgit-service-type’.  As its name indicates, an opaque
configuration does not have easy reflective capabilities.

   Available ‘opaque-cgit-configuration’ fields are:

 -- ‘opaque-cgit-configuration’ parameter: package cgit
     The cgit package.

 -- ‘opaque-cgit-configuration’ parameter: string string
     The contents of the ‘cgitrc’, as a string.

   For example, if your ‘cgitrc’ is just the empty string, you could
instantiate a cgit service like this:

     (service cgit-service-type
              (opaque-cgit-configuration
               (cgitrc "")))

Gitolite Service
................

Gitolite (https://gitolite.com/gitolite/) is a tool for hosting Git
repositories on a central server.

   Gitolite can handle multiple repositories and users, and supports
flexible configuration of the permissions for the users on the
repositories.

   The following example will configure Gitolite using the default ‘git’
user, and the provided SSH public key.

     (service gitolite-service-type
              (gitolite-configuration
                (admin-pubkey (plain-file
                                "yourname.pub"
                                "ssh-rsa AAAA... guix@example.com"))))

   Gitolite is configured through a special admin repository which you
can clone, for example, if you setup Gitolite on ‘example.com’, you
would run the following command to clone the admin repository.

     git clone git@example.com:gitolite-admin

   When the Gitolite service is activated, the provided ‘admin-pubkey’
will be inserted in to the ‘keydir’ directory in the gitolite-admin
repository.  If this results in a change in the repository, it will be
committed using the message “gitolite setup by GNU Guix”.

 -- Data Type: gitolite-configuration
     Data type representing the configuration for
     ‘gitolite-service-type’.

     ‘package’ (default: GITOLITE)
          Gitolite package to use.

     ‘user’ (default: GIT)
          User to use for Gitolite.  This will be user that you use when
          accessing Gitolite over SSH.

     ‘group’ (default: GIT)
          Group to use for Gitolite.

     ‘home-directory’ (default: "/VAR/LIB/GITOLITE")
          Directory in which to store the Gitolite configuration and
          repositories.

     ‘rc-file’ (default: (GITOLITE-RC-FILE))
          A “file-like” object (*note file-like objects: G-表达式.),
          representing the configuration for Gitolite.

     ‘admin-pubkey’ (default: #F)
          A “file-like” object (*note file-like objects: G-表达式.) used
          to setup Gitolite.  This will be inserted in to the ‘keydir’
          directory within the gitolite-admin repository.

          To specify the SSH key as a string, use the ‘plain-file’
          function.

               (plain-file "yourname.pub" "ssh-rsa AAAA... guix@example.com")

 -- Data Type: gitolite-rc-file
     Data type representing the Gitolite RC file.

     ‘umask’ (default: ‘#o0077’)
          This controls the permissions Gitolite sets on the
          repositories and their contents.

          A value like ‘#o0027’ will give read access to the group used
          by Gitolite (by default: ‘git’).  This is necessary when using
          Gitolite with software like cgit or gitweb.

     ‘git-config-keys’ (default: ‘""’)
          Gitolite allows you to set git config values using the
          ‘config’ keyword.  This setting allows control over the config
          keys to accept.

     ‘roles’ (default: ‘'(("READERS" . 1) ("WRITERS" . ))’)
          Set the role names allowed to be used by users running the
          perms command.

     ‘enable’ (default: ‘'("help" "desc" "info" "perms" "writable" "ssh-authkeys" "git-config" "daemon" "gitweb")’)
          This setting controls the commands and features to enable
          within Gitolite.

8.8.27 PAM Mount Service
------------------------

The ‘(gnu services pam-mount)’ module provides a service allowing users
to mount volumes when they log in.  It should be able to mount any
volume format supported by the system.

 -- Variable: Scheme Variable pam-mount-service-type
     Service type for PAM Mount support.

 -- Data Type: pam-mount-configuration
     Data type representing the configuration of PAM Mount.

     It takes the following parameters:

     ‘rules’
          The configuration rules that will be used to generate
          ‘/etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml’.

          The configuration rules are SXML elements (*note
          (guile)SXML::), and the the default ones don’t mount anything
          for anyone at login:

               `((debug (@ (enable "0")))
                 (mntoptions (@ (allow ,(string-join
                                         '("nosuid" "nodev" "loop"
                                           "encryption" "fsck" "nonempty"
                                           "allow_root" "allow_other")
                                         ","))))
                 (mntoptions (@ (require "nosuid,nodev")))
                 (logout (@ (wait "0")
                            (hup "0")
                            (term "no")
                            (kill "no")))
                 (mkmountpoint (@ (enable "1")
                                  (remove "true"))))

          Some ‘volume’ elements must be added to automatically mount
          volumes at login.  Here’s an example allowing the user ‘alice’
          to mount her encrypted ‘HOME’ directory and allowing the user
          ‘bob’ to mount the partition where he stores his data:

               (define pam-mount-rules
               `((debug (@ (enable "0")))
                           (volume (@ (user "alice")
                                      (fstype "crypt")
                                      (path "/dev/sda2")
                                      (mountpoint "/home/alice")))
                           (volume (@ (user "bob")
                                      (fstype "auto")
                                      (path "/dev/sdb3")
                                      (mountpoint "/home/bob/data")
                                      (options "defaults,autodefrag,compress")))
                           (mntoptions (@ (allow ,(string-join
                                                   '("nosuid" "nodev" "loop"

                                                     "allow_root" "allow_other")
                                                   ","))))
                           (mntoptions (@ (require "nosuid,nodev")))
                           (logout (@ (wait "0")
                                      (hup "0")
                                      (term "no")
                                      (kill "no")))
                           (mkmountpoint (@ (enable "1")
                                            (remove "true")))))

Kernel Module Loader Service
............................

The kernel module loader service allows one to load loadable kernel
modules at boot.  This is especially useful for modules that don’t
autoload and need to be manually loaded, as it’s the case with ‘ddcci’.

 -- Scheme Variable: kernel-module-loader-service-type
     The service type for loading loadable kernel modules at boot with
     ‘modprobe’.  Its value must be a list of strings representing

          (use-package-modules linux)
          (use-service-modules linux)

          (define ddcci-config
            (plain-file "ddcci.conf"
                        "options ddcci dyndbg delay=120"))

     Containerd.

     ‘package’ (default: ‘docker’)
          The Docker package to use.

     ‘containerd’ (default: CONTAINERD)
          The Containerd package to use.

Auditd Service
..............

The ‘(gnu services auditd)’ module provides the following service.

 -- Scheme Variable: auditd-service-type

     This is the type of the service that runs auditd
     (https://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/audit/), a daemon that tracks
     security-relevant information on your system.

     Examples of things that can be tracked:

       1. File accesses
       2. System calls
       3. Invoked commands
       4. Failed login attempts
       5. Firewall filtering
       6. Network access

     ‘auditctl’ from the ‘audit’ package can be used in order to add or
     remove events to be tracked (until the next reboot).  In order to
     permanently track events, put the command line arguments of
     auditctl into ‘/etc/audit/audit.rules’.  ‘aureport’ from the
     ‘audit’ package can be used in order to view a report of all
     recorded events.  The audit daemon usually logs into the directory
     ‘/var/log/audit’.

 -- Data Type: auditd-configuration
     This is the data type representing the configuration of auditd.

     ‘audit’ (default: ‘audit’)
          The audit package to use.

 -- Scheme Variable: singularity-service-type
     This is the type of the service that allows you to run Singularity
     (https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/), a Docker-style tool to create
     and run application bundles (aka.  “containers”).  The value for
     this service is the Singularity package to use.

     The service does not install a daemon; instead, it installs helper
     programs as setuid-root (*note setuid程序::) such that unprivileged
     users can invoke ‘singularity run’ and similar commands.

Nix service
...........

The ‘(gnu services nix)’ module provides the following service.

 -- Scheme Variable: nix-service-type

     This is the type of the service that runs build daemon of the Nix
     (https://nixos.org/nix/) package manager.  Here is an example
     showing how to use it:

          (use-modules (gnu))
          (use-service-modules nix)
          (use-package-modules package-management)

          (operating-system
            ;; ...
            (packages (append (list nix)
                              %base-packages))

            (services (append (list (service nix-service-type))
                              %base-services)))

     After ‘guix system reconfigure’ configure Nix for your user:

        • Add a Nix channel and update it.  See Nix Package Manager
          Guide (https://nixos.org/nix/manual/).

        • Create a symlink to your profile and activate Nix profile:

          $ ln -s "/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/$USER/profile" ~/.nix-profile
          $ source /run/current-system/profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh

8.9 setuid程序
==============

Some programs need to run with “root” privileges, even when they are
launched by unprivileged users.  A notorious example is the ‘passwd’
program, which users can run to change their password, and which needs
to access the ‘/etc/passwd’ and ‘/etc/shadow’ files—something normally
restricted to root, for obvious security reasons.  To address that,
these executables are “setuid-root”, meaning that they always run with
root privileges (*note (libc)How Change Persona::, for more info about
the setuid mechanism).

   The store itself _cannot_ contain setuid programs: that would be a
security issue since any user on the system can write derivations that
populate the store (*note 仓库::).  Thus, a different mechanism is used:
instead of changing the setuid bit directly on files that are in the
store, we let the system administrator _declare_ which programs should
be setuid root.

   The ‘setuid-programs’ field of an ‘operating-system’ declaration
contains a list of G-expressions denoting the names of programs to be
setuid-root (*note 使用配置系统::).  For instance, the ‘passwd’ program,
which is part of the Shadow package, can be designated by this
G-expression (*note G-表达式::):

     #~(string-append #$shadow "/bin/passwd")

   A default set of setuid programs is defined by the ‘%setuid-programs’
variable of the ‘(gnu system)’ module.

 -- Scheme Variable: %setuid-programs
     A list of G-expressions denoting common programs that are
     setuid-root.

     The list includes commands such as ‘passwd’, ‘ping’, ‘su’, and
     ‘sudo’.

   Under the hood, the actual setuid programs are created in the
‘/run/setuid-programs’ directory at system activation time.  The files
in this directory refer to the “real” binaries, which are in the store.


File: guix.zh_CN.info,  Node: X.509证书,  Next: Name Service Switch,  Prev: setuid程序,  Up: 系统配置

8.10 X.509证书
==============

Web servers available over HTTPS (that is, HTTP over the transport-layer
security mechanism, TLS) send client programs an “X.509 certificate”
that the client can then use to _authenticate_ the server.  To do that,
clients verify that the server’s certificate is signed by a so-called
“certificate authority” (CA). But to verify the CA’s signature, clients
must have first acquired the CA’s certificate.

   Web browsers such as GNU IceCat include their own set of CA
certificates, such that they are able to verify CA signatures
out-of-the-box.

   However, most other programs that can talk HTTPS—‘wget’, ‘git’,
‘w3m’, etc.—need to be told where CA certificates can be found.

   In Guix, this is done by adding a package that provides certificates
to the ‘packages’ field of the ‘operating-system’ declaration (*note
操作系统参考::).  Guix includes one such package, ‘nss-certs’, which is
a set of CA certificates provided as part of Mozilla’s Network Security
Services.

   Note that it is _not_ part of ‘%base-packages’, so you need to
explicitly add it.  The ‘/etc/ssl/certs’ directory, which is where most
applications and libraries look for certificates by default, points to
the certificates installed globally.

   Unprivileged users, including users of Guix on a foreign distro, can
also install their own certificate package in their profile.  A number
of environment variables need to be defined so that applications and
libraries know where to find them.  Namely, the OpenSSL library honors
the ‘SSL_CERT_DIR’ and ‘SSL_CERT_FILE’ variables.  Some applications add
their own environment variables; for instance, the Git version control
system honors the certificate bundle pointed to by the ‘GIT_SSL_CAINFO’
environment variable.  Thus, you would typically run something like:

     guix install nss-certs
     export SSL_CERT_DIR="$HOME/.guix-profile/etc/ssl/certs"
     export SSL_CERT_FILE="$HOME/.guix-profile/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
     export GIT_SSL_CAINFO="$SSL_CERT_FILE"

   As another example, R requires the ‘CURL_CA_BUNDLE’ environment
variable to point to a certificate bundle, so you would have to run
something like this:

     guix install nss-certs
     export CURL_CA_BUNDLE="$HOME/.guix-profile/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"

   For other applications you may want to look up the required
environment variable in the relevant documentation.

8.11 Name Service Switch
========================

The ‘(gnu system nss)’ module provides bindings to the configuration
file of the libc “name service switch” or “NSS” (*note (libc)NSS
Configuration File::).  In a nutshell, the NSS is a mechanism that
allows libc to be extended with new “name” lookup methods for system
databases, which includes host names, service names, user accounts, and
more (*note System Databases and Name Service Switch: (libc)Name Service
Switch.).

   The NSS configuration specifies, for each system database, which
lookup method is to be used, and how the various methods are chained
together—for instance, under which circumstances NSS should try the next
method in the list.  The NSS configuration is given in the
‘name-service-switch’ field of ‘operating-system’ declarations (*note
‘name-service-switch’: 操作系统参考.).

   As an example, the declaration below configures the NSS to use the
‘nss-mdns’ back-end (https://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/nss-mdns/),
which supports host name lookups over multicast DNS (mDNS) for host
names ending in ‘.local’:

     (name-service-switch
        (hosts (list %files    ;first, check /etc/hosts

                     ;; If the above did not succeed, try
                     ;; with 'mdns_minimal'.
                     (name-service
                       (name "mdns_minimal")

                       ;; 'mdns_minimal' is authoritative for
                       ;; '.local'.  When it returns "not found",
                       ;; no need to try the next methods.
                       (reaction (lookup-specification
                                  (not-found => return))))

                     ;; Then fall back to DNS.
                     (name-service
                       (name "dns"))

                     ;; Finally, try with the "full" 'mdns'.
                     (name-service
                       (name "mdns")))))

   Do not worry: the ‘%mdns-host-lookup-nss’ variable (see below)
contains this configuration, so you will not have to type it if all you
want is to have ‘.local’ host lookup working.

   Note that, in this case, in addition to setting the
‘name-service-switch’ of the ‘operating-system’ declaration, you also
need to use ‘avahi-service-type’ (*note ‘avahi-service-type’:
网络服务.), or ‘%desktop-services’, which includes it (*note
桌面服务::).  Doing this makes ‘nss-mdns’ accessible to the name service
cache daemon (*note ‘nscd-service’: 基础服务.).

   For convenience, the following variables provide typical NSS
configurations.

 -- Scheme Variable: %default-nss
     This is the default name service switch configuration, a
     ‘name-service-switch’ object.

 -- Scheme Variable: %mdns-host-lookup-nss
     This is the name service switch configuration with support for host
     name lookup over multicast DNS (mDNS) for host names ending in
     ‘.local’.

   The reference for name service switch configuration is given below.
It is a direct mapping of the configuration file format of the C library
, so please refer to the C library manual for more information (*note
(libc)NSS Configuration File::).  Compared to the configuration file
format of libc NSS, it has the advantage not only of adding this warm
parenthetic feel that we like, but also static checks: you will know
about syntax errors and typos as soon as you run ‘guix system’.

 -- Data Type: name-service-switch

     This is the data type representation the configuration of libc’s
     name service switch (NSS). Each field below represents one of the
     supported system databases.

     ‘aliases’
     ‘ethers’
     ‘group’
     ‘gshadow’
     ‘hosts’
     ‘initgroups’
     ‘netgroup’
     ‘networks’
     ‘password’
     ‘public-key’
     ‘rpc’
     ‘services’
     ‘shadow’
          The system databases handled by the NSS. Each of these fields
          must be a list of ‘<name-service>’ objects (see below).

 -- Data Type: name-service

     This is the data type representing an actual name service and the
     associated lookup action.

     ‘名字’
          A string denoting the name service (*note (libc)Services in
          the NSS configuration::).

          Note that name services listed here must be visible to nscd.
          This is achieved by passing the ‘#:name-services’ argument to
          ‘nscd-service’ the list of packages providing the needed name
          services (*note ‘nscd-service’: 基础服务.).

     ‘reaction’
          An action specified using the ‘lookup-specification’ macro
          (*note (libc)Actions in the NSS configuration::).  For
          example:

               (lookup-specification (unavailable => continue)
                                     (success => return))

8.12 初始的内存虚拟硬盘
=======================

For bootstrapping purposes, the Linux-Libre kernel is passed an “initial
RAM disk”, or “initrd”.  An initrd contains a temporary root file system
as well as an initialization script.  The latter is responsible for
mounting the real root file system, and for loading any kernel modules
that may be needed to achieve that.

   The ‘initrd-modules’ field of an ‘operating-system’ declaration
allows you to specify Linux-libre kernel modules that must be available
in the initrd.  In particular, this is where you would list modules
needed to actually drive the hard disk where your root partition
is—although the default value of ‘initrd-modules’ should cover most use
cases.  For example, assuming you need the ‘megaraid_sas’ module in
addition to the default modules to be able to access your root file
system, you would write:

     (operating-system
       ;; ...
       (initrd-modules (cons "megaraid_sas" %base-initrd-modules)))

 -- Scheme Variable: %base-initrd-modules
     This is the list of kernel modules included in the initrd by
     default.

   Furthermore, if you need lower-level customization, the ‘initrd’
field of an ‘operating-system’ declaration allows you to specify which
initrd you would like to use.  The ‘(gnu system linux-initrd)’ module
provides three ways to build an initrd: the high-level ‘base-initrd’
procedure and the low-level ‘raw-initrd’ and ‘expression->initrd’
procedures.

   The ‘base-initrd’ procedure is intended to cover most common uses.
For example, if you want to add a bunch of kernel modules to be loaded
at boot time, you can define the ‘initrd’ field of the operating system
declaration like this:

     (initrd (lambda (file-systems . rest)
               ;; Create a standard initrd but set up networking
               ;; with the parameters QEMU expects by default.
               (apply base-initrd file-systems
                      #:qemu-networking? #t
                      rest)))

   The ‘base-initrd’ procedure also handles common use cases that
involves using the system as a QEMU guest, or as a “live” system with
volatile root file system.

   The ‘base-initrd’ procedure is built from ‘raw-initrd’ procedure.
Unlike ‘base-initrd’, ‘raw-initrd’ doesn’t do anything high-level, such
as trying to guess which kernel modules and packages should be included
to the initrd.  An example use of ‘raw-initrd’ is when a user has a
custom Linux kernel configuration and default kernel modules included by
‘base-initrd’ are not available.

   The initial RAM disk produced by ‘base-initrd’ or ‘raw-initrd’ honors
several options passed on the Linux kernel command line (that is,
arguments passed via the ‘linux’ command of GRUB, or the ‘-append’
option of QEMU), notably:

‘--load=BOOT’
     Tell the initial RAM disk to load BOOT, a file containing a Scheme
     program, once it has mounted the root file system.

     Guix uses this option to yield control to a boot program that runs
     the service activation programs and then spawns the GNU Shepherd,
     the initialization system.

‘--root=ROOT’
     Mount ROOT as the root file system.  ROOT can be a device name like
     ‘/dev/sda1’, a file system label, or a file system UUID. When
     unspecified, the device name from the root file system of the
     operating system declaration is used.

‘--system=SYSTEM’
     Have ‘/run/booted-system’ and ‘/run/current-system’ point to
     SYSTEM.

‘modprobe.blacklist=MODULES...’
     Instruct the initial RAM disk as well as the ‘modprobe’ command
     (from the kmod package) to refuse to load MODULES.  MODULES must be
     a comma-separated list of module names—e.g., ‘usbkbd,9pnet’.

‘--repl’
     Start a read-eval-print loop (REPL) from the initial RAM disk
     before it tries to load kernel modules and to mount the root file
     system.  Our marketing team calls it “boot-to-Guile”.  The Schemer
     in you will love it.  *Note (guile)Using Guile Interactively::, for
     more information on Guile’s REPL.

   Now that you know all the features that initial RAM disks produced by
‘base-initrd’ and ‘raw-initrd’ provide, here is how to use it and
customize it further.

 -- Scheme Procedure: raw-initrd FILE-SYSTEMS [#:linux-modules '()]
          [#:mapped-devices '()]  [#:keyboard-layout #f]
          [#:helper-packages '()] [#:qemu-networking? #f]
          [#:volatile-root? #f] Return
     a derivation that builds a raw initrd.  FILE-SYSTEMS is a list of
     file systems to be mounted by the initrd, possibly in addition to
     the root file system specified on the kernel command line via
     ‘--root’.  LINUX-MODULES is a list of kernel modules to be loaded
     at boot time.  MAPPED-DEVICES is a list of device mappings to
     realize before FILE-SYSTEMS are mounted (*note 映射的设备::).
     HELPER-PACKAGES is a list of packages to be copied in the initrd.
     It may include ‘e2fsck/static’ or other packages needed by the
     initrd to check the root file system.

     When true, KEYBOARD-LAYOUT is a ‘<keyboard-layout>’ record denoting
     the desired console keyboard layout.  This is done before
     MAPPED-DEVICES are set up and before FILE-SYSTEMS are mounted such
     that, should the user need to enter a passphrase or use the REPL,
     this happens using the intended keyboard layout.

     When QEMU-NETWORKING? is true, set up networking with the standard
     QEMU parameters.  When VIRTIO? is true, load additional modules so
     that the initrd can be used as a QEMU guest with para-virtualized
     I/O drivers.

     When VOLATILE-ROOT? is true, the root file system is writable but
     any changes to it are lost.

 -- Scheme Procedure: base-initrd FILE-SYSTEMS [#:mapped-devices '()]
          [#:keyboard-layout #f]  [#:qemu-networking? #f]
     [#:volatile-root?  #f]  [#:linux-modules ’()] Return as a file-like
     object a generic initrd, with kernel modules taken from LINUX.
     FILE-SYSTEMS is a list of file-systems to be mounted by the initrd,
     possibly in addition to the root file system specified on the
     kernel command line via ‘--root’.  MAPPED-DEVICES is a list of
     device mappings to realize before FILE-SYSTEMS are mounted.

     When true, KEYBOARD-LAYOUT is a ‘<keyboard-layout>’ record denoting
     the desired console keyboard layout.  This is done before
     MAPPED-DEVICES are set up and before FILE-SYSTEMS are mounted such
     that, should the user need to enter a passphrase or use the REPL,
     this happens using the intended keyboard layout.

     QEMU-NETWORKING? and VOLATILE-ROOT? behaves as in ‘raw-initrd’.

     The initrd is automatically populated with all the kernel modules
     necessary for FILE-SYSTEMS and for the given options.  Additional
     kernel modules can be listed in LINUX-MODULES.  They will be added
     to the initrd, and loaded at boot time in the order in which they
     appear.

   Needless to say, the initrds we produce and use embed a
statically-linked Guile, and the initialization program is a Guile
program.  That gives a lot of flexibility.  The ‘expression->initrd’
procedure builds such an initrd, given the program to run in that
initrd.

 -- Scheme Procedure: expression->initrd EXP [#:guile
          %guile-3.0-static-stripped] [#:name "guile-initrd"] Return as
          a
     file-like object a Linux initrd (a gzipped cpio archive) containing
     GUILE and that evaluates EXP, a G-expression, upon booting.  All
     the derivations referenced by EXP are automatically copied to the
     initrd.

8.13 引导设置
=============

The operating system supports multiple bootloaders.  The bootloader is
configured using ‘bootloader-configuration’ declaration.  All the fields
of this structure are bootloader agnostic except for one field,
‘bootloader’ that indicates the bootloader to be configured and
installed.

   Some of the bootloaders do not honor every field of
‘bootloader-configuration’.  For instance, the extlinux bootloader does
not support themes and thus ignores the ‘theme’ field.

 -- Data Type: bootloader-configuration
     The type of a bootloader configuration declaration.

     ‘bootloader’
          The bootloader to use, as a ‘bootloader’ object.  For now
          ‘grub-bootloader’, ‘grub-efi-bootloader’,
          ‘extlinux-bootloader’ and ‘u-boot-bootloader’ are supported.

          ‘grub-efi-bootloader’ allows to boot on modern systems using
          the “Unified Extensible Firmware Interface” (UEFI). This is
          what you should use if the installation image contains a
          ‘/sys/firmware/efi’ directory when you boot it on your system.

          ‘grub-bootloader’ allows you to boot in particular Intel-based
          machines in “legacy” BIOS mode.

          Available bootloaders are described in ‘(gnu bootloader ...)’
          modules.  In particular, ‘(gnu bootloader u-boot)’ contains
          definitions of bootloaders for a wide range of ARM and AArch64
          systems, using the U-Boot bootloader
          (https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot/).

     ‘target’
          This is a string denoting the target onto which to install the
          bootloader.

          The interpretation depends on the bootloader in question.  For
          ‘grub-bootloader’, for example, it should be a device name
          understood by the bootloader ‘installer’ command, such as
          ‘/dev/sda’ or ‘(hd0)’ (*note (grub)Invoking grub-install::).
          For ‘grub-efi-bootloader’, it should be the mount point of the
          EFI file system, usually ‘/boot/efi’.

     ‘menu-entries’ (default: ‘()’)
          A possibly empty list of ‘menu-entry’ objects (see below),
          denoting entries to appear in the bootloader menu, in addition
          to the current system entry and the entry pointing to previous
          system generations.

     ‘default-entry’ (default: ‘0’)
          The index of the default boot menu entry.  Index 0 is for the
          entry of the current system.

     ‘timeout’ (default: ‘5’)
          The number of seconds to wait for keyboard input before
          booting.  Set to 0 to boot immediately, and to -1 to wait
          indefinitely.

     ‘keyboard-layout’ (default: ‘#f’)
          If this is ‘#f’, the bootloader’s menu (if any) uses the
          default keyboard layout, usually US English (“qwerty”).

          Otherwise, this must be a ‘keyboard-layout’ object (*note
          键盘布局::).

               注: This option is currently ignored by bootloaders other
               than ‘grub’ and ‘grub-efi’.

     ‘theme’ (default: #F)
          The bootloader theme object describing the theme to use.  If
          no theme is provided, some bootloaders might use a default
          theme, that’s true for GRUB.

     ‘terminal-outputs’ (default: ‘'(gfxterm)’)
          The output terminals used for the bootloader boot menu, as a
          list of symbols.  GRUB accepts the values: ‘console’,
          ‘serial’, ‘serial_{0-3}’, ‘gfxterm’, ‘vga_text’, ‘mda_text’,
          ‘morse’, and ‘pkmodem’.  This field corresponds to the GRUB
          variable ‘GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT’ (*note (grub)Simple
          configuration::).

     ‘terminal-inputs’ (default: ‘'()’)
          The input terminals used for the bootloader boot menu, as a
          list of symbols.  For GRUB, the default is the native platform
          terminal as determined at run-time.  GRUB accepts the values:
          ‘console’, ‘serial’, ‘serial_{0-3}’, ‘at_keyboard’, and
          ‘usb_keyboard’.  This field corresponds to the GRUB variable
          ‘GRUB_TERMINAL_INPUT’ (*note (grub)Simple configuration::).

     ‘serial-unit’ (default: ‘#f’)
          The serial unit used by the bootloader, as an integer from 0
          to 3.  For GRUB, it is chosen at run-time; currently GRUB
          chooses 0, which corresponds to COM1 (*note (grub)Serial
          terminal::).

     ‘serial-speed’ (default: ‘#f’)
          The speed of the serial interface, as an integer.  For GRUB,
          the default value is chosen at run-time; currently GRUB
          chooses 9600 bps (*note (grub)Serial terminal::).

   Should you want to list additional boot menu entries via the
‘menu-entries’ field above, you will need to create them with the
‘menu-entry’ form.  For example, imagine you want to be able to boot
another distro (hard to imagine!), you can define a menu entry along
these lines:

     (menu-entry
       (label "The Other Distro")
       (linux "/boot/old/vmlinux-2.6.32")
       (linux-arguments '("root=/dev/sda2"))
       (initrd "/boot/old/initrd"))

   Details below.

 -- Data Type: menu-entry
     The type of an entry in the bootloader menu.

     ‘label’
          The label to show in the menu—e.g., ‘"GNU"’.

     ‘linux’
          The Linux kernel image to boot, for example:

               (file-append linux-libre "/bzImage")

          For GRUB, it is also possible to specify a device explicitly
          in the file path using GRUB’s device naming convention (*note
          (grub)Naming convention::), for example:

               "(hd0,msdos1)/boot/vmlinuz"

          If the device is specified explicitly as above, then the
          ‘device’ field is ignored entirely.

     ‘linux-arguments’ (default: ‘()’)
          The list of extra Linux kernel command-line arguments—e.g.,
          ‘("console=ttyS0")’.

     ‘initrd’
          A G-Expression or string denoting the file name of the initial
          RAM disk to use (*note G-表达式::).
     ‘device’ (default: ‘#f’)
          The device where the kernel and initrd are to be found—i.e.,
          for GRUB, “root” for this menu entry (*note (grub)root::).

          This may be a file system label (a string), a file system UUID
          (a bytevector, *note 文件系统::), or ‘#f’, in which case the
          bootloader will search the device containing the file
          specified by the ‘linux’ field (*note (grub)search::).  It
          must _not_ be an OS device name such as ‘/dev/sda1’.

   For now only GRUB has theme support.  GRUB themes are created using
the ‘grub-theme’ form, which is not fully documented yet.

 -- Data Type: grub-theme
     Data type representing the configuration of the GRUB theme.

     ‘gfxmode’ (default: ‘'("auto")’)
          The GRUB ‘gfxmode’ to set (a list of screen resolution
          strings, see *note (grub)gfxmode::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: grub-theme
     Return the default GRUB theme used by the operating system if no
     ‘theme’ field is specified in ‘bootloader-configuration’ record.

     It comes with a fancy background image displaying the GNU and Guix
     logos.

   For example, to override the default resolution, you may use
something like

     (bootloader
      (bootloader-configuration
      ;; ...
      (theme (grub-theme
              (inherit (grub-theme))
              (gfxmode '("1024x786x32" "auto"))))))

8.14 Invoking ‘guix system’
===========================

Once you have written an operating system declaration as seen in the
previous section, it can be “instantiated” using the ‘guix system’
command.  The synopsis is:

     guix system OPTIONS... ACTION FILE

   FILE must be the name of a file containing an ‘operating-system’
declaration.  ACTION specifies how the operating system is instantiated.
Currently the following values are supported:

‘search’
     Display available service type definitions that match the given
     regular expressions, sorted by relevance:

          $ guix system search console
          name: console-fonts
          location: gnu/services/base.scm:806:2
          extends: shepherd-root
          description: Install the given fonts on the specified ttys (fonts are per
          + virtual console on GNU/Linux).  The value of this service is a list of
          + tty/font pairs.  The font can be the name of a font provided by the `kbd'
          + package or any valid argument to `setfont', as in this example:
          +
          +      '(("tty1" . "LatGrkCyr-8x16")
          +        ("tty2" . (file-append
          +                      font-tamzen
          +                      "/share/kbd/consolefonts/TamzenForPowerline10x20.psf"))
          +        ("tty3" . (file-append
          +                      font-terminus
          +                      "/share/consolefonts/ter-132n"))) ; for HDPI
          relevance: 9

          name: mingetty
          location: gnu/services/base.scm:1190:2
          extends: shepherd-root
          description: Provide console login using the `mingetty' program.
          relevance: 2

          name: login
          location: gnu/services/base.scm:860:2
          extends: pam
          description: Provide a console log-in service as specified by its
          + configuration value, a `login-configuration' object.
          relevance: 2

          ...

     As for ‘guix package --search’, the result is written in ‘recutils’
     format, which makes it easy to filter the output (*note GNU
     recutils databases: (recutils)Top.).

‘reconfigure’
     Build the operating system described in FILE, activate it, and
     switch to it(1).

          注: It is highly recommended to run ‘guix pull’ once before
          you run ‘guix system reconfigure’ for the first time (*note
          调用guix pull::).  Failing to do that you would see an older
          version of Guix once ‘reconfigure’ has completed.

     This effects all the configuration specified in FILE: user
     accounts, system services, global package list, setuid programs,
     etc.  The command starts system services specified in FILE that are
     not currently running; if a service is currently running this
     command will arrange for it to be upgraded the next time it is
     stopped (e.g. by ‘herd stop X’ or ‘herd restart X’).

     This command creates a new generation whose number is one greater
     than the current generation (as reported by ‘guix system
     list-generations’).  If that generation already exists, it will be
     overwritten.  This behavior mirrors that of ‘guix package’ (*note
     调用guix package::).

     It also adds a bootloader menu entry for the new OS configuration,
     —unless ‘--no-bootloader’ is passed.  For GRUB, it moves entries
     for older configurations to a submenu, allowing you to choose an
     older system generation at boot time should you need it.

     Upon completion, the new system is deployed under
     ‘/run/current-system’.  This directory contains “provenance
     meta-data”: the list of channels in use (*note 通道::) and FILE
     itself, when available.  This information is useful should you
     later want to inspect how this particular generation was built.

     In fact, assuming FILE is self-contained, you can later rebuild
     generation N of your operating system with:

          guix time-machine \
            -C /var/guix/profiles/system-N-link/channels.scm -- \
            system reconfigure \
            /var/guix/profiles/system-N-link/configuration.scm

     You can think of it as some sort of built-in version control!  Your
     system is not just a binary artifact: _it carries its own source_.
     *Note ‘provenance-service-type’: 服务参考, for more information on
     provenance tracking.

‘switch-generation’
     Switch to an existing system generation.  This action atomically
     switches the system profile to the specified system generation.  It
     also rearranges the system’s existing bootloader menu entries.  It
     makes the menu entry for the specified system generation the
     default, and it moves the entries for the other generations to a
     submenu, if supported by the bootloader being used.  The next time
     the system boots, it will use the specified system generation.

     The bootloader itself is not being reinstalled when using this
     command.  Thus, the installed bootloader is used with an updated
     configuration file.

     The target generation can be specified explicitly by its generation
     number.  For example, the following invocation would switch to
     system generation 7:

          guix system switch-generation 7

     The target generation can also be specified relative to the current
     generation with the form ‘+N’ or ‘-N’, where ‘+3’ means “3
     generations ahead of the current generation,” and ‘-1’ means “1
     generation prior to the current generation.” When specifying a
     negative value such as ‘-1’, you must precede it with ‘--’ to
     prevent it from being parsed as an option.  For example:

          guix system switch-generation -- -1

     Currently, the effect of invoking this action is _only_ to switch
     the system profile to an existing generation and rearrange the
     bootloader menu entries.  To actually start using the target system
     generation, you must reboot after running this action.  In the
     future, it will be updated to do the same things as ‘reconfigure’,
     like activating and deactivating services.

     This action will fail if the specified generation does not exist.

‘roll-back’
     Switch to the preceding system generation.  The next time the
     system boots, it will use the preceding system generation.  This is
     the inverse of ‘reconfigure’, and it is exactly the same as
     invoking ‘switch-generation’ with an argument of ‘-1’.

     Currently, as with ‘switch-generation’, you must reboot after
     running this action to actually start using the preceding system
     generation.

‘delete-generations’
     Delete system generations, making them candidates for garbage
     collection (*note 调用guix gc::, for information on how to run the
     “garbage collector”).

     This works in the same way as ‘guix package --delete-generations’
     (*note ‘--delete-generations’: 调用guix package.).  With no
     arguments, all system generations but the current one are deleted:

          guix system delete-generations

     You can also select the generations you want to delete.  The
     example below deletes all the system generations that are more than
     two month old:

          guix system delete-generations 2m

     Running this command automatically reinstalls the bootloader with
     an updated list of menu entries—e.g., the “old generations”
     sub-menu in GRUB no longer lists the generations that have been
     deleted.

‘build’
     Build the derivation of the operating system, which includes all
     the configuration files and programs needed to boot and run the
     system.  This action does not actually install anything.

‘init’
     Populate the given directory with all the files necessary to run
     the operating system specified in FILE.  This is useful for
     first-time installations of Guix System.  For instance:

          guix system init my-os-config.scm /mnt

     copies to ‘/mnt’ all the store items required by the configuration
     specified in ‘my-os-config.scm’.  This includes configuration
     files, packages, and so on.  It also creates other essential files
     needed for the system to operate correctly—e.g., the ‘/etc’,
     ‘/var’, and ‘/run’ directories, and the ‘/bin/sh’ file.

     This command also installs bootloader on the target specified in
     ‘my-os-config’, unless the ‘--no-bootloader’ option was passed.

‘vm’
     Build a virtual machine that contains the operating system declared
     in FILE, and return a script to run that virtual machine (VM).

          注: The ‘vm’ action and others below can use KVM support in
          the Linux-libre kernel.  Specifically, if the machine has
          hardware virtualization support, the corresponding KVM kernel
          module should be loaded, and the ‘/dev/kvm’ device node must
          exist and be readable and writable by the user and by the
          build users of the daemon (*note 设置构建环境::).

     Arguments given to the script are passed to QEMU as in the example
     below, which enables networking and requests 1 GiB of RAM for the
     emulated machine:

          $ /gnu/store/...-run-vm.sh -m 1024 -smp 2 -net user,model=virtio-net-pci

     The VM shares its store with the host system.

     Additional file systems can be shared between the host and the VM
     using the ‘--share’ and ‘--expose’ command-line options: the former
     specifies a directory to be shared with write access, while the
     latter provides read-only access to the shared directory.

     The example below creates a VM in which the user’s home directory
     is accessible read-only, and where the ‘/exchange’ directory is a
     read-write mapping of ‘$HOME/tmp’ on the host:

          guix system vm my-config.scm \
             --expose=$HOME --share=$HOME/tmp=/exchange

     On GNU/Linux, the default is to boot directly to the kernel; this
     has the advantage of requiring only a very tiny root disk image
     since the store of the host can then be mounted.

     The ‘--full-boot’ option forces a complete boot sequence, starting
     with the bootloader.  This requires more disk space since a root
     image containing at least the kernel, initrd, and bootloader data
     files must be created.  The ‘--image-size’ option can be used to
     specify the size of the image.

‘vm-image’
‘disk-image’
‘docker-image’
     Return a virtual machine, disk image, or Docker image of the
     operating system declared in FILE that stands alone.  By default,
     ‘guix system’ estimates the size of the image needed to store the
     system, but you can use the ‘--image-size’ option to specify a
     value.  Docker images are built to contain exactly what they need,
     so the ‘--image-size’ option is ignored in the case of
     ‘docker-image’.

     You can specify the root file system type by using the
     ‘--file-system-type’ option.  It defaults to ‘ext4’.

     When using ‘vm-image’, the returned image is in qcow2 format, which
     the QEMU emulator can efficiently use.  *Note 在虚拟机里运行Guix::,
     for more information on how to run the image in a virtual machine.

     When using ‘disk-image’, a raw disk image is produced; it can be
     copied as is to a USB stick, for instance.  Assuming ‘/dev/sdc’ is
     the device corresponding to a USB stick, one can copy the image to
     it using the following command:

          # dd if=$(guix system disk-image my-os.scm) of=/dev/sdc

     When using ‘docker-image’, a Docker image is produced.  Guix builds
     the image from scratch, not from a pre-existing Docker base image.
     As a result, it contains _exactly_ what you define in the operating
     system configuration file.  You can then load the image and launch
     a Docker container using commands like the following:

          image_id="`docker load < guix-system-docker-image.tar.gz`"
          container_id="`docker create $image_id`"
          docker start $container_id

     This command starts a new Docker container from the specified
     image.  It will boot the Guix system in the usual manner, which
     means it will start any services you have defined in the operating
     system configuration.  You can get an interactive shell running in
     the container using ‘docker exec’:

          docker exec -ti $container_id /run/current-system/profile/bin/bash --login

     Depending on what you run in the Docker container, it may be
     necessary to give the container additional permissions.  For
     example, if you intend to build software using Guix inside of the
     Docker container, you may need to pass the ‘--privileged’ option to
     ‘docker create’.

     Last, the ‘--network’ option applies to ‘guix system docker-image’:
     it produces an image where network is supposedly shared with the
     host, and thus without services like nscd or NetworkManager.

‘container’
     Return a script to run the operating system declared in FILE within
     a container.  Containers are a set of lightweight isolation
     mechanisms provided by the kernel Linux-libre.  Containers are
     substantially less resource-demanding than full virtual machines
     since the kernel, shared objects, and other resources can be shared
     with the host system; this also means they provide thinner
     isolation.

     Currently, the script must be run as root in order to support more
     than a single user and group.  The container shares its store with
     the host system.

     As with the ‘vm’ action (*note guix system vm::), additional file
     systems to be shared between the host and container can be
     specified using the ‘--share’ and ‘--expose’ options:

          guix system container my-config.scm \
             --expose=$HOME --share=$HOME/tmp=/exchange

          注: This option requires Linux-libre 3.19 or newer.

   OPTIONS can contain any of the common build options (*note
普通的构建选项::).  In addition, OPTIONS can contain one of the
following:

‘--expression=EXPR’
‘-e EXPR’
     Consider the operating-system EXPR evaluates to.  This is an
     alternative to specifying a file which evaluates to an operating
     system.  This is used to generate the Guix system installer *note
     构建安装镜像::).

‘--system=SYSTEM’
‘-s SYSTEM’
     Attempt to build for SYSTEM instead of the host system type.  This
     works as per ‘guix build’ (*note 调用guix build::).

‘--derivation’
‘-d’
     Return the derivation file name of the given operating system
     without building anything.

‘--save-provenance’
     As discussed above, ‘guix system init’ and ‘guix system
     reconfigure’ always save provenance information via a dedicated
     service (*note ‘provenance-service-type’: 服务参考.).  However,
     other commands don’t do that by default.  If you wish to, say,
     create a virtual machine image that contains provenance
     information, you can run:

          guix system vm-image --save-provenance config.scm

     That way, the resulting image will effectively “embed its own
     source” in the form of meta-data in ‘/run/current-system’.  With
     that information, one can rebuild the image to make sure it really
     contains what it pretends to contain; or they could use that to
     derive a variant of the image.

‘--file-system-type=TYPE’
‘-t TYPE’
     For the ‘disk-image’ action, create a file system of the given TYPE
     on the image.

     When this option is omitted, ‘guix system’ uses ‘ext4’.

     ‘--file-system-type=iso9660’ produces an ISO-9660 image, suitable
     for burning on CDs and DVDs.

‘--image-size=SIZE’
     For the ‘vm-image’ and ‘disk-image’ actions, create an image of the
     given SIZE.  SIZE may be a number of bytes, or it may include a
     unit as a suffix (*note size specifications: (coreutils)Block
     size.).

     When this option is omitted, ‘guix system’ computes an estimate of
     the image size as a function of the size of the system declared in
     FILE.

‘--network’
‘-N’
     For the ‘container’ action, allow containers to access the host
     network, that is, do not create a network namespace.

‘--root=FILE’
‘-r FILE’
     Make FILE a symlink to the result, and register it as a garbage
     collector root.

‘--skip-checks’
     Skip pre-installation safety checks.

     By default, ‘guix system init’ and ‘guix system reconfigure’
     perform safety checks: they make sure the file systems that appear
     in the ‘operating-system’ declaration actually exist (*note
     文件系统::), and that any Linux kernel modules that may be needed
     at boot time are listed in ‘initrd-modules’ (*note
     初始的内存虚拟硬盘::).  Passing this option skips these tests
     altogether.

‘--on-error=STRATEGY’
     Apply STRATEGY when an error occurs when reading FILE.  STRATEGY
     may be one of the following:

     ‘nothing-special’
          Report the error concisely and exit.  This is the default
          strategy.

     ‘backtrace’
          Likewise, but also display a backtrace.

     ‘debug’
          Report the error and enter Guile’s debugger.  From there, you
          can run commands such as ‘,bt’ to get a backtrace, ‘,locals’
          to display local variable values, and more generally inspect
          the state of the program.  *Note (guile)Debug Commands::, for
          a list of available debugging commands.

   Once you have built, configured, re-configured, and re-re-configured
your Guix installation, you may find it useful to list the operating
system generations available on disk—and that you can choose from the
bootloader boot menu:

‘describe’
     Describe the current system generation: its file name, the kernel
     and bootloader used, etc., as well as provenance information when
     available.

‘list-generations’
     List a summary of each generation of the operating system available
     on disk, in a human-readable way.  This is similar to the
     ‘--list-generations’ option of ‘guix package’ (*note 调用guix
     package::).

     Optionally, one can specify a pattern, with the same syntax that is
     used in ‘guix package --list-generations’, to restrict the list of
     generations displayed.  For instance, the following command
     displays generations that are up to 10 days old:

          $ guix system list-generations 10d

   The ‘guix system’ command has even more to offer!  The following
sub-commands allow you to visualize how your system services relate to
each other:

‘extension-graph’
     Emit in Dot/Graphviz format to standard output the “service
     extension graph” of the operating system defined in FILE (*note
     合成服务::, for more information on service extensions).

     The command:

          $ guix system extension-graph FILE | xdot -

     shows the extension relations among services.

‘shepherd-graph’
     Emit in Dot/Graphviz format to standard output the “dependency
     graph” of shepherd services of the operating system defined in
     FILE.  *Note Shepherd服务::, for more information and for an
     example graph.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This action (and the related actions ‘switch-generation’ and
‘roll-back’) are usable only on systems already running Guix System.

8.15 Invoking ‘guix deploy’
===========================

We’ve already seen ‘operating-system’ declarations used to manage a
machine’s configuration locally.  Suppose you need to configure multiple
machines, though—perhaps you’re managing a service on the web that’s
comprised of several servers.  ‘guix deploy’ enables you to use those
same ‘operating-system’ declarations to manage multiple remote hosts at
once as a logical “deployment”.

     注: The functionality described in this section is still under
     development and is subject to change.  Get in touch with us on
     <guix-devel@gnu.org>!

     guix deploy FILE

   Such an invocation will deploy the machines that the code within FILE
evaluates to.  As an example, FILE might contain a definition like this:

     ;; This is a Guix deployment of a "bare bones" setup, with
     ;; no X11 display server, to a machine with an SSH daemon
     ;; listening on localhost:2222. A configuration such as this
     ;; may be appropriate for virtual machine with ports
     ;; forwarded to the host's loopback interface.

     (use-service-modules networking ssh)
     (use-package-modules bootloaders)

     (define %system
       (operating-system
        (host-name "gnu-deployed")
        (timezone "Etc/UTC")
        (bootloader (bootloader-configuration
                     (bootloader grub-bootloader)
                     (target "/dev/vda")
                     (terminal-outputs '(console))))
        (file-systems (cons (file-system
                             (mount-point "/")
                             (device "/dev/vda1")
                             (type "ext4"))
                            %base-file-systems))
        (services
         (append (list (service dhcp-client-service-type)
                       (service openssh-service-type
                                (openssh-configuration
                                 (permit-root-login #t)
                                 (allow-empty-passwords? #t))))
                 %base-services))))

     (list (machine
            (operating-system %system)
            (environment managed-host-environment-type)
            (configuration (machine-ssh-configuration
                            (host-name "localhost")
                            (system "x86_64-linux")
                            (user "alice")
                            (identity "./id_rsa")
                            (port 2222)))))

   The file should evaluate to a list of MACHINE objects.  This example,
upon being deployed, will create a new generation on the remote system
realizing the ‘operating-system’ declaration ‘%system’.  ‘environment’
and ‘configuration’ specify how the machine should be provisioned—that
is, how the computing resources should be created and managed.  The
above example does not create any resources, as a ‘'managed-host’ is a
machine that is already running the Guix system and available over the
network.  This is a particularly simple case; a more complex deployment
may involve, for example, starting virtual machines through a Virtual
Private Server (VPS) provider.  In such a case, a different ENVIRONMENT
type would be used.

   Do note that you first need to generate a key pair on the coordinator
machine to allow the daemon to export signed archives of files from the
store (*note 调用guix archive::).

     # guix archive --generate-key

Each target machine must authorize the key of the master machine so that
it accepts store items it receives from the coordinator:

     # guix archive --authorize < coordinator-public-key.txt

   ‘user’, in this example, specifies the name of the user account to
log in as to perform the deployment.  Its default value is ‘root’, but
root login over SSH may be forbidden in some cases.  To work around
this, ‘guix deploy’ can log in as an unprivileged user and employ ‘sudo’
to escalate privileges.  This will only work if ‘sudo’ is currently
installed on the remote and can be invoked non-interactively as ‘user’.
That is, the line in ‘sudoers’ granting ‘user’ the ability to use ‘sudo’
must contain the ‘NOPASSWD’ tag.  This can be accomplished with the
following operating system configuration snippet:

     (use-modules ...
                  (gnu system))               ;for %sudoers-specification

     (define %user "username")

     (operating-system
       ...
       (sudoers-file
          (plain-file "sudoers"
                      (string-append (plain-file-content %sudoers-specification)
                                     (format #f "~a ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL~%"
                                             %user)))))


   For more information regarding the format of the ‘sudoers’ file,
consult ‘man sudoers’.

 -- Data Type: machine
     This is the data type representing a single machine in a
     heterogeneous Guix deployment.

     ‘operating-system’
          The object of the operating system configuration to deploy.

     ‘environment’
          An ‘environment-type’ describing how the machine should be
          provisioned.

     ‘configuration’ (default: ‘#f’)
          An object describing the configuration for the machine’s
          ‘environment’.  If the ‘environment’ has a default
          configuration, ‘#f’ may be used.  If ‘#f’ is used for an
          environment with no default configuration, however, an error
          will be thrown.

 -- Data Type: machine-ssh-configuration
     This is the data type representing the SSH client parameters for a
     machine with an ‘environment’ of ‘managed-host-environment-type’.

     ‘host-name’
     ‘build-locally?’ (default: ‘#t’)
          If false, system derivations will be built on the machine
          being deployed to.
     ‘系统’
          The system type describing the architecture of the machine
          being deployed to—e.g., ‘"x86_64-linux"’.
     ‘authorize?’ (default: ‘#t’)
          If true, the coordinator’s signing key will be added to the
          remote’s ACL keyring.
     ‘port’（默认值：‘22’）
     ‘user’ (default: ‘"root"’)

          authenticate with the remote host.

     ‘host-key’ (default: ‘#f’)
          This should be the SSH host key of the machine, which looks
          like this:

               ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nz... root@example.org

          When ‘host-key’ is ‘#f’, the server is authenticated against
          the ‘~/.ssh/known_hosts’ file, just like the OpenSSH ‘ssh’
          client does.

 -- Data Type: digital-ocean-configuration
     This is the data type describing the Droplet that should be created
     for a machine with an ‘environment’ of

8.16 Running Guix in a Virtual Machine
======================================

To run Guix in a virtual machine (VM), one can use the pre-built Guix VM
image distributed at
<https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-system-vm-image-1.0.1.17089-7e269.x86_64-linux.xz>.
This image is a compressed image in QCOW format.  You will first need to
decompress with ‘xz -d’, and then you can pass it to an emulator such as
QEMU (see below for details).

   This image boots the Xfce graphical environment and it contains some
commonly-used tools.  You can install more software in the image by
running ‘guix package’ in a terminal (*note 调用guix package::).  You
can also reconfigure the system based on its initial configuration file
available as ‘/run/current-system/configuration.scm’ (*note
使用配置系统::).

   Instead of using this pre-built image, one can also build their own
virtual machine image using ‘guix system vm-image’ (*note 调用guix
system::).  The returned image is in qcow2 format, which the QEMU
emulator (https://qemu.org/) can efficiently use.

   If you built your own image, you must copy it out of the store (*note
仓库::) and give yourself permission to write to the copy before you can
use it.  When invoking QEMU, you must choose a system emulator that is
suitable for your hardware platform.  Here is a minimal QEMU invocation
that will boot the result of ‘guix system vm-image’ on x86_64 hardware:

     $ qemu-system-x86_64 \
        -nic user,model=virtio-net-pci \
        -enable-kvm -m 1024 \
        -device virtio-blk,drive=myhd \
        -drive if=none,file=/tmp/qemu-image,id=myhd

   Here is what each of these options means:

‘qemu-system-x86_64’
     This specifies the hardware platform to emulate.  This should match
     the host.

‘-nic user,model=virtio-net-pci’
     Enable the unprivileged user-mode network stack.  The guest OS can
     access the host but not vice versa.  This is the simplest way to
     get the guest OS online.  ‘model’ specifies which network device to
     emulate: ‘virtio-net-pci’ is a special device made for virtualized
     operating systems and recommended for most uses.  Assuming your
     hardware platform is x86_64, you can get a list of available NIC
     models by running ‘qemu-system-x86_64 -nic model=help’.

‘-enable-kvm’
     If your system has hardware virtualization extensions, enabling the
     virtual machine support (KVM) of the Linux kernel will make things
     run faster.

‘-m 1024’
     RAM available to the guest OS, in mebibytes.  Defaults to 128 MiB,
     which may be insufficient for some operations.

‘-device virtio-blk,drive=myhd’
     Create a ‘virtio-blk’ drive called “myhd”.  ‘virtio-blk’ is a
     “paravirtualization” mechanism for block devices that allows QEMU
     to achieve better performance than if it were emulating a complete
     disk drive.  See the QEMU and KVM documentation for more info.

‘-drive if=none,file=/tmp/qemu-image,id=myhd’
     Use our QCOW image, the ‘/tmp/qemu-image’ file, as the backing
     store the the “myhd” drive.

   The default ‘run-vm.sh’ script that is returned by an invocation of
‘guix system vm’ does not add a ‘-nic user’ flag by default.  To get
network access from within the vm add the ‘(dhcp-client-service)’ to
your system definition and start the VM using ‘`guix system vm
config.scm` -nic user’.  An important caveat of using ‘-nic user’ for
networking is that ‘ping’ will not work, because it uses the ICMP
protocol.  You’ll have to use a different command to check for network
connectivity, for example ‘guix download’.

8.16.1 Connecting Through SSH
-----------------------------

To enable SSH inside a VM you need to add an SSH server like
‘openssh-service-type’ to your VM (*note ‘openssh-service-type’:
网络服务.).  In addition you need to forward the SSH port, 22 by
default, to the host.  You can do this with

     `guix system vm config.scm` -nic user,model=virtio-net-pci,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22

   To connect to the VM you can run

     ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -p 10022

   The ‘-p’ tells ‘ssh’ the port you want to connect to.  ‘-o
UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null’ prevents ‘ssh’ from complaining every time
you modify your ‘config.scm’ file and the ‘-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no’
prevents you from having to allow a connection to an unknown host every
time you connect.

8.16.2 Using ‘virt-viewer’ with Spice
-------------------------------------

As an alternative to the default ‘qemu’ graphical client you can use the
‘remote-viewer’ from the ‘virt-viewer’ package.  To connect pass the
‘-spice port=5930,disable-ticketing’ flag to ‘qemu’.  See previous
section for further information on how to do this.

   Spice also allows you to do some nice stuff like share your clipboard
with your VM. To enable that you’ll also have to pass the following
flags to ‘qemu’:

     -device virtio-serial-pci,id=virtio-serial0,max_ports=16,bus=pci.0,addr=0x5
     -chardev spicevmc,name=vdagent,id=vdagent
     -device virtserialport,nr=1,bus=virtio-serial0.0,chardev=vdagent,
     name=com.redhat.spice.0

   You’ll also need to add the ‘(spice-vdagent-service)’ to your system
definition (*note Spice service: 其它各种服务.).

8.17 定义服务
=============

The previous sections show the available services and how one can
combine them in an ‘operating-system’ declaration.  But how do we define
them in the first place?  And what is a service anyway?

Here we define a “service” as, broadly, something that extends the
functionality of the operating system.  Often a service is a process—a
“daemon”—started when the system boots: a secure shell server, a Web
server, the Guix build daemon, etc.  Sometimes a service is a daemon
whose execution can be triggered by another daemon—e.g., an FTP server
started by ‘inetd’ or a D-Bus service activated by ‘dbus-daemon’.
Occasionally, a service does not map to a daemon.  For instance, the
“account” service collects user accounts and makes sure they exist when
the system runs; the “udev” service collects device management rules and
makes them available to the eudev daemon; the ‘/etc’ service populates
the ‘/etc’ directory of the system.

   Guix system services are connected by “extensions”.  For instance,
the secure shell service _extends_ the Shepherd—the initialization
system, running as PID 1—by giving it the command lines to start and
stop the secure shell daemon (*note ‘openssh-service-type’: 网络服务.);
the UPower service extends the D-Bus service by passing it its
‘.service’ specification, and extends the udev service by passing it
device management rules (*note ‘upower-service’: 桌面服务.); the Guix
daemon service extends the Shepherd by passing it the command lines to
start and stop the daemon, and extends the account service by passing it
a list of required build user accounts (*note 基础服务::).

   All in all, services and their “extends” relations form a directed
acyclic graph (DAG). If we represent services as boxes and extensions as
arrows, a typical system might provide something like this:

[Typical service extension graph.]
   At the bottom, we see the “system service”, which produces the
directory containing everything to run and boot the system, as returned
by the ‘guix system build’ command.  *Note 服务参考::, to learn about
the other service types shown here.  *Note the ‘guix system
extension-graph’ command: system-extension-graph, for information on how
to generate this representation for a particular operating system
definition.

   Technically, developers can define “service types” to express these
relations.  There can be any number of services of a given type on the
system—for instance, a system running two instances of the GNU secure
shell server (lsh) has two instances of ‘lsh-service-type’, with
different parameters.

   The following section describes the programming interface for service
types and services.

8.17.2 服务类型和服务
---------------------

A “service type” is a node in the DAG described above.  Let us start
with a simple example, the service type for the Guix build daemon (*note
调用guix-daemon::):

     (define guix-service-type
       (service-type
        (name 'guix)
        (extensions
         (list (service-extension shepherd-root-service-type guix-shepherd-service)
               (service-extension account-service-type guix-accounts)
               (service-extension activation-service-type guix-activation)))
        (default-value (guix-configuration))))

It defines three things:

  1. A name, whose sole purpose is to make inspection and debugging
     easier.

  2. A list of “service extensions”, where each extension designates the
     target service type and a procedure that, given the parameters of
     the service, returns a list of objects to extend the service of
     that type.

     Every service type has at least one service extension.  The only
     exception is the “boot service type”, which is the ultimate
     service.

  3. Optionally, a default value for instances of this type.

   In this example, ‘guix-service-type’ extends three services:

‘shepherd-root-service-type’
     The ‘guix-shepherd-service’ procedure defines how the Shepherd
     service is extended.  Namely, it returns a ‘<shepherd-service>’
     object that defines how ‘guix-daemon’ is started and stopped (*note
     Shepherd服务::).

‘account-service-type’
     This extension for this service is computed by ‘guix-accounts’,
     which returns a list of ‘user-group’ and ‘user-account’ objects
     representing the build user accounts (*note 调用guix-daemon::).

‘activation-service-type’
     Here ‘guix-activation’ is a procedure that returns a gexp, which is
     a code snippet to run at “activation time”—e.g., when the service
     is booted.

   A service of this type is instantiated like this:

     (service guix-service-type
              (guix-configuration
                (build-accounts 5)
                (use-substitutes? #f)))

   The second argument to the ‘service’ form is a value representing the
parameters of this specific service instance.  *Note
‘guix-configuration’: guix-configuration-type, for information about the
‘guix-configuration’ data type.  When the value is omitted, the default
value specified by ‘guix-service-type’ is used:

     (service guix-service-type)

   ‘guix-service-type’ is quite simple because it extends other services
but is not extensible itself.

   The service type for an _extensible_ service looks like this:

     (define udev-service-type
       (service-type (name 'udev)
                     (extensions
                      (list (service-extension shepherd-root-service-type
                                               udev-shepherd-service)))

                     (compose concatenate)       ;concatenate the list of rules
                     (extend (lambda (config rules)
                               (match config
                                 (($ <udev-configuration> udev initial-rules)
                                  (udev-configuration
                                   (udev udev)   ;the udev package to use
                                   (rules (append initial-rules rules)))))))))

   This is the service type for the eudev device management daemon
(https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Eudev).  Compared to the previous
example, in addition to an extension of ‘shepherd-root-service-type’, we
see two new fields:

‘compose’
     This is the procedure to “compose” the list of extensions to
     services of this type.

     Services can extend the udev service by passing it lists of rules;
     we compose those extensions simply by concatenating them.

‘extend’
     This procedure defines how the value of the service is “extended”
     with the composition of the extensions.

     Udev extensions are composed into a list of rules, but the udev
     service value is itself a ‘<udev-configuration>’ record.  So here,
     we extend that record by appending the list of rules it contains to
     the list of contributed rules.

‘description’
     This is a string giving an overview of the service type.  The
     string can contain Texinfo markup (*note (texinfo)Overview::).  The
     ‘guix system search’ command searches these strings and displays
     them (*note 调用guix system::).

   There can be only one instance of an extensible service type such as
‘udev-service-type’.  If there were more, the ‘service-extension’
specifications would be ambiguous.

   Still here?  The next section provides a reference of the programming
interface for services.

8.17.3 服务参考
---------------

We have seen an overview of service types (*note 服务类型和服务::).
This section provides a reference on how to manipulate services and
service types.  This interface is provided by the ‘(gnu services)’
module.

 -- Scheme Procedure: service TYPE [VALUE]
     Return a new service of TYPE, a ‘<service-type>’ object (see
     below).  VALUE can be any object; it represents the parameters of
     this particular service instance.

     When VALUE is omitted, the default value specified by TYPE is used;
     if TYPE does not specify a default value, an error is raised.

     For instance, this:

          (service openssh-service-type)

     is equivalent to this:

          (service openssh-service-type
                   (openssh-configuration))

     In both cases the result is an instance of ‘openssh-service-type’
     with the default configuration.

 -- Scheme Procedure: service? OBJ
     Return true if OBJ is a service.

 -- Scheme Procedure: service-kind SERVICE
     Return the type of SERVICE—i.e., a ‘<service-type>’ object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: service-value SERVICE
     Return the value associated with SERVICE.  It represents its
     parameters.

   Here is an example of how a service is created and manipulated:

     (define s
       (service nginx-service-type
                (nginx-configuration
                 (nginx nginx)
                 (log-directory log-directory)
                 (run-directory run-directory)
                 (file config-file))))

     (service? s)
     ⇒ #t

     (eq? (service-kind s) nginx-service-type)
     ⇒ #t

   The ‘modify-services’ form provides a handy way to change the
parameters of some of the services of a list such as ‘%base-services’
(*note ‘%base-services’: 基础服务.).  It evaluates to a list of
services.  Of course, you could always use standard list combinators
such as ‘map’ and ‘fold’ to do that (*note List Library:
(guile)SRFI-1.); ‘modify-services’ simply provides a more concise form
for this common pattern.

 -- Scheme Syntax: modify-services SERVICES (TYPE VARIABLE => BODY) ...

     Modify the services listed in SERVICES according to the given
     clauses.  Each clause has the form:

          (TYPE VARIABLE => BODY)

     where TYPE is a service type—e.g., ‘guix-service-type’—and VARIABLE
     is an identifier that is bound within the BODY to the service
     parameters—e.g., a ‘guix-configuration’ instance—of the original
     service of that TYPE.

     The BODY should evaluate to the new service parameters, which will
     be used to configure the new service.  This new service will
     replace the original in the resulting list.  Because a service’s
     service parameters are created using ‘define-record-type*’, you can
     write a succinct BODY that evaluates to the new service parameters
     by using the ‘inherit’ feature that ‘define-record-type*’ provides.

     *Note 使用配置系统::, for example usage.

   Next comes the programming interface for service types.  This is
something you want to know when writing new service definitions, but not
necessarily when simply looking for ways to customize your
‘operating-system’ declaration.

 -- Data Type: service-type
     This is the representation of a “service type” (*note
     服务类型和服务::).

     ‘名字’
          This is a symbol, used only to simplify inspection and
          debugging.

     ‘extensions’
          A non-empty list of ‘<service-extension>’ objects (see below).

     ‘compose’ (default: ‘#f’)
          If this is ‘#f’, then the service type denotes services that
          cannot be extended—i.e., services that do not receive “values”
          from other services.

          Otherwise, it must be a one-argument procedure.  The procedure
          is called by ‘fold-services’ and is passed a list of values
          collected from extensions.  It may return any single value.

     ‘extend’ (default: ‘#f’)
          If this is ‘#f’, services of this type cannot be extended.

          Otherwise, it must be a two-argument procedure:
          ‘fold-services’ calls it, passing it the initial value of the
          service as the first argument and the result of applying
          ‘compose’ to the extension values as the second argument.  It
          must return a value that is a valid parameter value for the
          service instance.

     *Note 服务类型和服务::, for examples.

 -- Scheme Procedure: service-extension TARGET-TYPE COMPUTE Return a new
          extension for services of type
     TARGET-TYPE.  COMPUTE must be a one-argument procedure:
     ‘fold-services’ calls it, passing it the value associated with the
     service that provides the extension; it must return a valid value
     for the target service.

 -- Scheme Procedure: service-extension? OBJ
     Return true if OBJ is a service extension.

   Occasionally, you might want to simply extend an existing service.
This involves creating a new service type and specifying the extension
of interest, which can be verbose; the ‘simple-service’ procedure
provides a shorthand for this.

 -- Scheme Procedure: simple-service NAME TARGET VALUE
     Return a service that extends TARGET with VALUE.  This works by
     creating a singleton service type NAME, of which the returned
     service is an instance.

     For example, this extends mcron (*note 执行计划任务::) with an
     additional job:

          (simple-service 'my-mcron-job mcron-service-type
                          #~(job '(next-hour (3)) "guix gc -F 2G"))

   At the core of the service abstraction lies the ‘fold-services’
procedure, which is responsible for “compiling” a list of services down
to a single directory that contains everything needed to boot and run
the system—the directory shown by the ‘guix system build’ command (*note
调用guix system::).  In essence, it propagates service extensions down
the service graph, updating each node parameters on the way, until it
reaches the root node.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fold-services SERVICES [#:target-type
          SYSTEM-SERVICE-TYPE] Fold SERVICES by propagating
     their extensions down to the root of type TARGET-TYPE; return the
     root service adjusted accordingly.

   Lastly, the ‘(gnu services)’ module also defines several essential
service types, some of which are listed below.

 -- Scheme Variable: system-service-type
     This is the root of the service graph.  It produces the system
     directory as returned by the ‘guix system build’ command.

 -- Scheme Variable: boot-service-type
     The type of the “boot service”, which produces the “boot script”.
     The boot script is what the initial RAM disk runs when booting.

 -- Scheme Variable: etc-service-type
     The type of the ‘/etc’ service.  This service is used to create
     files under ‘/etc’ and can be extended by passing it name/file
     tuples such as:

          (list `("issue" ,(plain-file "issue" "Welcome!\n")))

     In this example, the effect would be to add an ‘/etc/issue’ file
     pointing to the given file.

 -- Scheme Variable: setuid-program-service-type
     Type for the “setuid-program service”.  This service collects lists
     of executable file names, passed as gexps, and adds them to the set
     of setuid-root programs on the system (*note setuid程序::).

 -- Scheme Variable: profile-service-type
     Type of the service that populates the “system profile”—i.e., the
     programs under ‘/run/current-system/profile’.  Other services can
     extend it by passing it lists of packages to add to the system
     profile.

 -- Scheme Variable: provenance-service-type
     This is the type of the service that records “provenance meta-data”
     in the system itself.  It creates several files under
     ‘/run/current-system’:

     ‘channels.scm’
          This is a “channel file” that can be passed to ‘guix pull -C’
          or ‘guix time-machine -C’, and which describes the channels
          used to build the system, if that information was available
          (*note 通道::).

     ‘configuration.scm’
          This is the file that was passed as the value for this
          ‘provenance-service-type’ service.  By default, ‘guix system
          reconfigure’ automatically passes the OS configuration file it
          received on the command line.

     ‘provenance’
          This contains the same information as the two other files but
          in a format that is more readily processable.

     In general, these two pieces of information (channels and
     configuration file) are enough to reproduce the operating system
     “from source”.

          Caveats: This information is necessary to rebuild your
          operating system, but it is not always sufficient.  In
          particular, ‘configuration.scm’ itself is insufficient if it
          is not self-contained—if it refers to external Guile modules
          or to extra files.  If you want ‘configuration.scm’ to be
          self-contained, we recommend that modules or files it refers
          to be part of a channel.

          Besides, provenance meta-data is “silent” in the sense that it
          does not change the bits contained in your system, _except for
          the meta-data bits themselves_.  Two different OS
          configurations or sets of channels can lead to the same
          system, bit-for-bit; when ‘provenance-service-type’ is used,
          these two systems will have different meta-data and thus
          different store file names, which makes comparison less
          trivial.

     This service is automatically added to your operating system
     configuration when you use ‘guix system reconfigure’, ‘guix system
     init’, or ‘guix deploy’.

8.17.4 Shepherd服务
-------------------

The ‘(gnu services shepherd)’ module provides a way to define services
managed by the GNU Shepherd, which is the initialization system—the
first process that is started when the system boots, also known as PID 1
(*note (shepherd)介绍::).

   Services in the Shepherd can depend on each other.  For instance, the
SSH daemon may need to be started after the syslog daemon has been
started, which in turn can only happen once all the file systems have
been mounted.  The simple operating system defined earlier (*note
使用配置系统::) results in a service graph like this:

[Typical shepherd service graph.]
   You can actually generate such a graph for any operating system
definition using the ‘guix system shepherd-graph’ command (*note ‘guix
system shepherd-graph’: system-shepherd-graph.).

   The ‘%shepherd-root-service’ is a service object representing PID 1,
of type ‘shepherd-root-service-type’; it can be extended by passing it
lists of ‘<shepherd-service>’ objects.

 -- Data Type: shepherd-service
     The data type representing a service managed by the Shepherd.

     ‘provision’
          This is a list of symbols denoting what the service provides.

          These are the names that may be passed to ‘herd start’, ‘herd
          status’, and similar commands (*note (shepherd)Invoking
          herd::).  *Note the ‘provides’ slot: (shepherd)Slots of
          services, for details.

     ‘requirement’ (default: ‘'()’)
          List of symbols denoting the Shepherd services this one
          depends on.

     ‘one-shot?’ (default: ‘#f’)
          Whether this service is “one-shot”.  One-shot services stop
          immediately after their ‘start’ action has completed.  *Note
          (shepherd)Slots of services::, for more info.

     ‘respawn?’ (default: ‘#t’)
          Whether to restart the service when it stops, for instance
          when the underlying process dies.

     ‘start’
     ‘stop’ (default: ‘#~(const #f)’)
          The ‘start’ and ‘stop’ fields refer to the Shepherd’s
          facilities to start and stop processes (*note
          (shepherd)Service De- and Constructors::).  They are given as
          G-expressions that get expanded in the Shepherd configuration
          file (*note G-表达式::).

     ‘actions’ (default: ‘'()’)
          This is a list of ‘shepherd-action’ objects (see below)
          defining “actions” supported by the service, in addition to
          the standard ‘start’ and ‘stop’ actions.  Actions listed here
          become available as ‘herd’ sub-commands:

               herd ACTION SERVICE [ARGUMENTS...]

     ‘auto-start?’ (default: ‘#t’)
          Whether this service should be started automatically by the
          Shepherd.  If it is ‘#f’ the service has to be started
          manually with ‘herd start’.

     ‘documentation’
          A documentation string, as shown when running:

               herd doc SERVICE-NAME

          where SERVICE-NAME is one of the symbols in ‘provision’ (*note
          (shepherd)Invoking herd::).

     ‘modules’ (default: ‘%default-modules’)
          This is the list of modules that must be in scope when ‘start’
          and ‘stop’ are evaluated.

 -- Data Type: shepherd-action
     This is the data type that defines additional actions implemented
     by a Shepherd service (see above).

     ‘名字’
          Symbol naming the action.

     ‘documentation’
          This is a documentation string for the action.  It can be
          viewed by running:

               herd doc SERVICE action ACTION

     ‘procedure’
          This should be a gexp that evaluates to a procedure of at
          least one argument, which is the “running value” of the
          service (*note (shepherd)Slots of services::).

     The following example defines an action called ‘say-hello’ that
     kindly greets the user:

          (shepherd-action
            (name 'say-hello)
            (documentation "Say hi!")
            (procedure #~(lambda (running . args)
                           (format #t "Hello, friend! arguments: ~s\n"
                                   args)
                           #t)))

     Assuming this action is added to the ‘example’ service, then you
     can do:

          # herd say-hello example
          Hello, friend! arguments: ()
          # herd say-hello example a b c
          Hello, friend! arguments: ("a" "b" "c")

     This, as you can see, is a fairly sophisticated way to say hello.
     *Note (shepherd)Service Convenience::, for more info on actions.

 -- Scheme Variable: shepherd-root-service-type
     The service type for the Shepherd “root service”—i.e., PID 1.

     This is the service type that extensions target when they want to
     create shepherd services (*note 服务类型和服务::, for an example).
     Each extension must pass a list of ‘<shepherd-service>’.

 -- Scheme Variable: %shepherd-root-service
     This service represents PID 1.

******

In most cases packages installed with Guix come with documentation.
There are two main documentation formats: “Info”, a browseable hypertext
format used for GNU software, and “manual pages” (or “man pages”), the
linear documentation format traditionally found on Unix.  Info manuals
are accessed with the ‘info’ command or with Emacs, and man pages are
accessed using ‘man’.

   You can look for documentation of software installed on your system
by keyword.  For example, the following command searches for information
about “TLS” in Info manuals:

     $ info -k TLS
     "(emacs)Network Security" -- STARTTLS
     "(emacs)Network Security" -- TLS
     "(gnutls)Core TLS API" -- gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags
     "(gnutls)Core TLS API" -- gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function
     ...

The command below searches for the same keyword in man pages:

     $ man -k TLS
     SSL (7)              - OpenSSL SSL/TLS library
     certtool (1)         - GnuTLS certificate tool
     ...

   These searches are purely local to your computer so you have the
guarantee that documentation you find corresponds to what you have
actually installed, you can access it off-line, and your privacy is
respected.

   Once you have these results, you can view the relevant documentation
by running, say:

     $ info "(gnutls)Core TLS API"

***************

Program binaries, as produced by the GCC compilers for instance, are
typically written in the ELF format, with a section containing
“debugging information”.  Debugging information is what allows the
debugger, GDB, to map binary code to source code; it is required to
debug a compiled program in good conditions.

   The problem with debugging information is that is takes up a fair
amount of disk space.  For example, debugging information for the GNU C
Library weighs in at more than 60 MiB. Thus, as a user, keeping all the
debugging info of all the installed programs is usually not an option.
Yet, space savings should not come at the cost of an impediment to
debugging—especially in the GNU system, which should make it easier for
users to exert their computing freedom (*note GNU发行版::).

   Thankfully, the GNU Binary Utilities (Binutils) and GDB provide a
mechanism that allows users to get the best of both worlds: debugging
information can be stripped from the binaries and stored in separate
files.  GDB is then able to load debugging information from those files,
when they are available (*note (gdb)Separate Debug Files::).

   The GNU distribution takes advantage of this by storing debugging
information in the ‘lib/debug’ sub-directory of a separate package
output unimaginatively called ‘debug’ (*note 有多个输出的软件包::).
Users can choose to install the ‘debug’ output of a package when they
need it.  For instance, the following command installs the debugging
information for the GNU C Library and for GNU Guile:

     guix install glibc:debug guile:debug

   GDB must then be told to look for debug files in the user’s profile,
by setting the ‘debug-file-directory’ variable (consider setting it from
the ‘~/.gdbinit’ file, *note (gdb)Startup::):

     (gdb) set debug-file-directory ~/.guix-profile/lib/debug

   From there on, GDB will pick up debugging information from the
‘.debug’ files under ‘~/.guix-profile/lib/debug’.

   In addition, you will most likely want GDB to be able to show the
source code being debugged.  To do that, you will have to unpack the
source code of the package of interest (obtained with ‘guix build
--source’, *note 调用guix build::), and to point GDB to that source
directory using the ‘directory’ command (*note ‘directory’: (gdb)Source
Path.).

   The ‘debug’ output mechanism in Guix is implemented by the
‘gnu-build-system’ (*note 构建系统::).  Currently, it is
opt-in—debugging information is available only for the packages with
definitions explicitly declaring a ‘debug’ output.  This may be changed
to opt-out in the future if our build farm servers can handle the load.
To check whether a package has a ‘debug’ output, use ‘guix package
--list-available’ (*note 调用guix package::).

Occasionally, important security vulnerabilities are discovered in
software packages and must be patched.  Guix developers try hard to keep
track of known vulnerabilities and to apply fixes as soon as possible in
the ‘master’ branch of Guix (we do not yet provide a “stable” branch
containing only security updates).  The ‘guix lint’ tool helps
developers find out about vulnerable versions of software packages in
the distribution:

     $ guix lint -c cve
     gnu/packages/base.scm:652:2: glibc@2.21: probably vulnerable to CVE-2015-1781, CVE-2015-7547
     gnu/packages/gcc.scm:334:2: gcc@4.9.3: probably vulnerable to CVE-2015-5276
     gnu/packages/image.scm:312:2: openjpeg@2.1.0: probably vulnerable to CVE-2016-1923, CVE-2016-1924
     ...

   *Note 调用guix lint::, for more information.

   Guix follows a functional package management discipline (*note
介绍::), which implies that, when a package is changed, _every package
that depends on it_ must be rebuilt.  This can significantly slow down
the deployment of fixes in core packages such as libc or Bash, since
basically the whole distribution would need to be rebuilt.  Using
pre-built binaries helps (*note Substitutes::), but deployment may still
take more time than desired.

   To address this, Guix implements “grafts”, a mechanism that allows
for fast deployment of critical updates without the costs associated
with a whole-distribution rebuild.  The idea is to rebuild only the
package that needs to be patched, and then to “graft” it onto packages
explicitly installed by the user and that were previously referring to
the original package.  The cost of grafting is typically very low, and
order of magnitudes lower than a full rebuild of the dependency chain.

   For instance, suppose a security update needs to be applied to Bash.
Guix developers will provide a package definition for the “fixed” Bash,
say ‘bash-fixed’, in the usual way (*note 定义软件包::).  Then, the
original package definition is augmented with a ‘replacement’ field
pointing to the package containing the bug fix:

     (define bash
       (package
         (name "bash")
         ;; ...
         (replacement bash-fixed)))

   From there on, any package depending directly or indirectly on
Bash—as reported by ‘guix gc --requisites’ (*note 调用guix gc::)—that is
installed is automatically “rewritten” to refer to ‘bash-fixed’ instead
of ‘bash’.  This grafting process takes time proportional to the size of
the package, usually less than a minute for an “average” package on a
recent machine.  Grafting is recursive: when an indirect dependency
requires grafting, then grafting “propagates” up to the package that the
user is installing.

   Currently, the length of the name and version of the graft and that
of the package it replaces (‘bash-fixed’ and ‘bash’ in the example
above) must be equal.  This restriction mostly comes from the fact that
grafting works by patching files, including binary files, directly.
Other restrictions may apply: for instance, when adding a graft to a
package providing a shared library, the original shared library and its
replacement must have the same ‘SONAME’ and be binary-compatible.

   The ‘--no-grafts’ command-line option allows you to forcefully avoid
grafting (*note ‘--no-grafts’: 普通的构建选项.).  Thus, the command:

     guix build bash --no-grafts

returns the store file name of the original Bash, whereas:

     guix build bash

returns the store file name of the “fixed”, replacement Bash.  This
allows you to distinguish between the two variants of Bash.

   To verify which Bash your whole profile refers to, you can run (*note
调用guix gc::):

     guix gc -R `readlink -f ~/.guix-profile` | grep bash

... and compare the store file names that you get with those above.
Likewise for a complete Guix system generation:

     guix gc -R `guix system build my-config.scm` | grep bash

   Lastly, to check which Bash running processes are using, you can use
the ‘lsof’ command:

     lsof | grep /gnu/store/.*bash

Bootstrapping in our context refers to how the distribution gets built
“from nothing”.  Remember that the build environment of a derivation
contains nothing but its declared inputs (*note 介绍::).  So there’s an
obvious chicken-and-egg problem: how does the first package get built?
How does the first compiler get compiled?  Note that this is a question
of interest only to the curious hacker, not to the regular user, so you
can shamelessly skip this section if you consider yourself a “regular
user”.

   The GNU system is primarily made of C code, with libc at its core.
The GNU build system itself assumes the availability of a Bourne shell
and command-line tools provided by GNU Coreutils, Awk, Findutils, ‘sed’,
and ‘grep’.  Furthermore, build programs—programs that run
‘./configure’, ‘make’, etc.—are written in Guile Scheme (*note
Derivations::).  Consequently, to be able to build anything at all, from
scratch, Guix relies on pre-built binaries of Guile, GCC, Binutils,
libc, and the other packages mentioned above—the “bootstrap binaries”.

   These bootstrap binaries are “taken for granted”, though we can also
re-create them if needed (*note Preparing to Use the Bootstrap
Binaries::).

* Menu:

* Reduced Binary Seed Bootstrap::  A Bootstrap worthy of GNU.
* Preparing to Use the Bootstrap Binaries::  Building that what matters

File: guix.zh_CN.info,  Node: Reduced Binary Seed Bootstrap,  Next: Preparing to Use the Bootstrap Binaries,  Up: 引导

12.1 The Reduced Binary Seed Bootstrap
======================================

Guix—like other GNU/Linux distributions—is traditionally bootstrapped
from a set of bootstrap binaries: Bourne shell, command-line tools
provided by GNU Coreutils, Awk, Findutils, ‘sed’, and ‘grep’ and Guile,
GCC, Binutils, and the GNU C Library (*note 引导::).  Usually, these
bootstrap binaries are “taken for granted.”

   Taking the bootstrap binaries for granted means that we consider them
to be a correct and trustworthy “seed” for building the complete system.
Therein lies a problem: the combined size of these bootstrap binaries is
about 250MB (*note (mes)Bootstrappable Builds::).  Auditing or even
inspecting these is next to impossible.

   For ‘i686-linux’ and ‘x86_64-linux’, Guix now features a “Reduced
Binary Seed” bootstrap (1).

   The Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap removes the most critical
tools—from a trust perspective—from the bootstrap binaries: GCC,
Binutils and the GNU C Library are replaced by: ‘bootstrap-mescc-tools’
(a tiny assembler and linker) and ‘bootstrap-mes’ (a small Scheme
Interpreter and a C compiler written in Scheme and the Mes C Library,
built for TinyCC and for GCC).

   Using these new binary seeds the “missing” Binutils, GCC, and the GNU
C Library are built from source.  From here on the more traditional
bootstrap process resumes.  This approach has reduced the bootstrap
binaries in size to about 145MB in Guix v1.1.

   The next step that Guix has taken is to replace the shell and all its
utilities with implementations in Guile Scheme, the _Scheme-only
bootstrap_.  Gash (*note (gash)Gash::) is a POSIX-compatible shell that
replaces Bash, and it comes with Gash Utils which has minimalist
replacements for Awk, the GNU Core Utilities, Grep, Gzip, Sed, and Tar.
The rest of the bootstrap binary seeds that were removed are now built
from source.

   Building the GNU System from source is currently only possibly by
adding some historical GNU packages as intermediate steps(2).  As Gash
and Gash Utils mature, and GNU packages become more bootstrappable again
(e.g., new releases of GNU Sed will also ship as gzipped tarballs again,
as alternative to the hard to bootstrap ‘xz’-compression), this set of
added packages can hopefully be reduced again.

   The graph below shows the resulting dependency graph for
‘gcc-core-mesboot0’, the bootstrap compiler used for the traditional
bootstrap of the rest of the Guix System.

[Dependency graph of
gcc-core-mesboot0]
   The only significant binary bootstrap seeds that remain(3) are a
Scheme intepreter and a Scheme compiler: GNU Mes and GNU Guile(4).

   This further reduction has brought down the size of the binary seed
to about 60MB for ‘i686-linux’ and ‘x86_64-linux’.

   Work is ongoing to remove all binary blobs from our free software
bootstrap stack, working towards a Full Source Bootstrap.  Also ongoing
is work to bring these bootstraps to the ‘arm-linux’ and ‘aarch64-linux’
architectures and to the Hurd.

   If you are interested, join us on ‘#bootstrappable’ on the Freenode
IRC network or discuss on <bug-mes@gnu.org> or <gash-devel@nongnu.org>.

12.2 Preparing to Use the Bootstrap Binaries
============================================

[Dependency graph of the early bootstrap
derivations]
The figure above shows the very beginning of the dependency graph of the
distribution, corresponding to the package definitions of the ‘(gnu
packages bootstrap)’ module.  A similar figure can be generated with
‘guix graph’ (*note 调用guix graph::), along the lines of:

     guix graph -t derivation \
       -e '(@@ (gnu packages bootstrap) %bootstrap-gcc)' \
       | dot -Tps > gcc.ps

   or, for the further Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap

     guix graph -t derivation \
       -e '(@@ (gnu packages bootstrap) %bootstrap-mes)' \
       | dot -Tps > mes.ps

   At this level of detail, things are slightly complex.  First, Guile
itself consists of an ELF executable, along with many source and
compiled Scheme files that are dynamically loaded when it runs.  This
gets stored in the ‘guile-2.0.7.tar.xz’ tarball shown in this graph.
This tarball is part of Guix’s “source” distribution, and gets inserted
into the store with ‘add-to-store’ (*note 仓库::).

   But how do we write a derivation that unpacks this tarball and adds
it to the store?  To solve this problem, the ‘guile-bootstrap-2.0.drv’
derivation—the first one that gets built—uses ‘bash’ as its builder,
which runs ‘build-bootstrap-guile.sh’, which in turn calls ‘tar’ to
unpack the tarball.  Thus, ‘bash’, ‘tar’, ‘xz’, and ‘mkdir’ are
statically-linked binaries, also part of the Guix source distribution,
whose sole purpose is to allow the Guile tarball to be unpacked.

   Once ‘guile-bootstrap-2.0.drv’ is built, we have a functioning Guile
that can be used to run subsequent build programs.  Its first task is to
download tarballs containing the other pre-built binaries—this is what
the ‘.tar.xz.drv’ derivations do.  Guix modules such as ‘ftp-client.scm’
are used for this purpose.  The ‘module-import.drv’ derivations import
those modules in a directory in the store, using the original layout.
The ‘module-import-compiled.drv’ derivations compile those modules, and
write them in an output directory with the right layout.  This
corresponds to the ‘#:modules’ argument of
‘build-expression->derivation’ (*note Derivations::).

   Finally, the various tarballs are unpacked by the derivations
‘gcc-bootstrap-0.drv’, ‘glibc-bootstrap-0.drv’, or ‘bootstrap-mes-0.drv’
and ‘bootstrap-mescc-tools-0.drv’, at which point we have a working C
tool chain.

Building the Build Tools
========================

Bootstrapping is complete when we have a full tool chain that does not
depend on the pre-built bootstrap tools discussed above.  This
no-dependency requirement is verified by checking whether the files of
the final tool chain contain references to the ‘/gnu/store’ directories
of the bootstrap inputs.  The process that leads to this “final” tool
chain is described by the package definitions found in the ‘(gnu
packages commencement)’ module.

   The ‘guix graph’ command allows us to “zoom out” compared to the
graph above, by looking at the level of package objects instead of
individual derivations—remember that a package may translate to several
derivations, typically one derivation to download its source, one to
build the Guile modules it needs, and one to actually build the package
from source.  The command:

     guix graph -t bag \
       -e '(@@ (gnu packages commencement)
               glibc-final-with-bootstrap-bash)' | xdot -

displays the dependency graph leading to the “final” C library(1),
depicted below.

[Dependency graph of the early
packages]
   The first tool that gets built with the bootstrap binaries is
GNU Make—noted ‘make-boot0’ above—which is a prerequisite for all the
following packages.  From there Findutils and Diffutils get built.

   Then come the first-stage Binutils and GCC, built as pseudo cross
tools—i.e., with ‘--target’ equal to ‘--host’.  They are used to build
libc.  Thanks to this cross-build trick, this libc is guaranteed not to
hold any reference to the initial tool chain.

   From there the final Binutils and GCC (not shown above) are built.
GCC uses ‘ld’ from the final Binutils, and links programs against the
just-built libc.  This tool chain is used to build the other packages
used by Guix and by the GNU Build System: Guile, Bash, Coreutils, etc.

   And voilà!  At this point we have the complete set of build tools
that the GNU Build System expects.  These are in the ‘%final-inputs’
variable of the ‘(gnu packages commencement)’ module, and are implicitly
used by any package that uses ‘gnu-build-system’ (*note
‘gnu-build-system’: 构建系统.).

Building the Bootstrap Binaries
===============================

Because the final tool chain does not depend on the bootstrap binaries,
those rarely need to be updated.  Nevertheless, it is useful to have an
automated way to produce them, should an update occur, and this is what
the ‘(gnu packages make-bootstrap)’ module provides.

   The following command builds the tarballs containing the bootstrap
binaries (Binutils, GCC, glibc, for the traditional bootstrap and
linux-libre-headers, bootstrap-mescc-tools, bootstrap-mes for the
Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap, and Guile, and a tarball containing a
mixture of Coreutils and other basic command-line tools):

     guix build bootstrap-tarballs

   The generated tarballs are those that should be referred to in the
‘(gnu packages bootstrap)’ module mentioned at the beginning of this
section.

   Still here?  Then perhaps by now you’ve started to wonder: when do we
reach a fixed point?  That is an interesting question!  The answer is
unknown, but if you would like to investigate further (and have
significant computational and storage resources to do so), then let us
know.

Reducing the Set of Bootstrap Binaries
======================================

Our traditional bootstrap includes GCC, GNU Libc, Guile, etc.  That’s a
lot of binary code!  Why is that a problem?  It’s a problem because
these big chunks of binary code are practically non-auditable, which
makes it hard to establish what source code produced them.  Every
unauditable binary also leaves us vulnerable to compiler backdoors as
described by Ken Thompson in the 1984 paper _Reflections on Trusting
Trust_.

   This is mitigated by the fact that our bootstrap binaries were
generated from an earlier Guix revision.  Nevertheless it lacks the
level of transparency that we get in the rest of the package dependency
graph, where Guix always gives us a source-to-binary mapping.  Thus, our
goal is to reduce the set of bootstrap binaries to the bare minimum.

   The Bootstrappable.org web site (https://bootstrappable.org) lists
on-going projects to do that.  One of these is about replacing the
bootstrap GCC with a sequence of assemblers, interpreters, and compilers
of increasing complexity, which could be built from source starting from
a simple and auditable assembler.

   Our first major achievement is the replacement of of GCC, the GNU C
Library and Binutils by MesCC-Tools (a simple hex linker and macro
assembler) and Mes (*note GNU Mes Reference Manual: (mes)Top, a Scheme
interpreter and C compiler in Scheme).  Neither MesCC-Tools nor Mes can
be fully bootstrapped yet and thus we inject them as binary seeds.  We
call this the Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap, as it has halved the size
of our bootstrap binaries!  Also, it has eliminated the C compiler
binary; i686-linux and x86_64-linux Guix packages are now bootstrapped
without any binary C compiler.

   Work is ongoing to make MesCC-Tools and Mes fully bootstrappable and
we are also looking at any other bootstrap binaries.  Your help is
welcome!

   (1) You may notice the ‘glibc-intermediate’ label, suggesting that it
is not _quite_ final, but as a good approximation, we will consider it
final.

13 Porting to a New Platform
****************************

As discussed above, the GNU distribution is self-contained, and
self-containment is achieved by relying on pre-built “bootstrap
binaries” (*note 引导::).  These binaries are specific to an operating
system kernel, CPU architecture, and application binary interface (ABI).
Thus, to port the distribution to a platform that is not yet supported,
one must build those bootstrap binaries, and update the ‘(gnu packages
bootstrap)’ module to use them on that platform.

   Fortunately, Guix can _cross compile_ those bootstrap binaries.  When
everything goes well, and assuming the GNU tool chain supports the
target platform, this can be as simple as running a command like this
one:

     guix build --target=armv5tel-linux-gnueabi bootstrap-tarballs

   For this to work, the ‘glibc-dynamic-linker’ procedure in ‘(gnu
packages bootstrap)’ must be augmented to return the right file name for
libc’s dynamic linker on that platform; likewise,
‘system->linux-architecture’ in ‘(gnu packages linux)’ must be taught
about the new platform.

   Once these are built, the ‘(gnu packages bootstrap)’ module needs to
be updated to refer to these binaries on the target platform.  That is,
the hashes and URLs of the bootstrap tarballs for the new platform must
be added alongside those of the currently supported platforms.  The
bootstrap Guile tarball is treated specially: it is expected to be
available locally, and ‘gnu/local.mk’ has rules to download it for the
supported architectures; a rule for the new platform must be added as
well.

   In practice, there may be some complications.  First, it may be that
the extended GNU triplet that specifies an ABI (like the ‘eabi’ suffix
above) is not recognized by all the GNU tools.  Typically, glibc
recognizes some of these, whereas GCC uses an extra ‘--with-abi’
configure flag (see ‘gcc.scm’ for examples of how to handle this).
Second, some of the required packages could fail to build for that
platform.  Lastly, the generated binaries could be broken for some
reason.

14.1 从Git构建
==============

如果你想折腾Guix本身，建议使用Git仓库里最新的版本：

     git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git

   How do you ensure that you obtained a genuine copy of the repository?
Guix itself provides a tool to “authenticate” your checkout, but you
must first make sure this tool is genuine in order to “bootstrap” the
trust chain.  To do that, run:

     git verify-commit `git log --format=%H build-aux/git-authenticate.scm`

   The output must look something like:

     gpg: Signature made Fri 27 Dec 2019 01:27:41 PM CET
     gpg:                using RSA key 3CE464558A84FDC69DB40CFB090B11993D9AEBB5
     ...
     gpg: Signature made Fri 27 Dec 2019 01:25:22 PM CET
     gpg:                using RSA key 3CE464558A84FDC69DB40CFB090B11993D9AEBB5
     ...

...  meaning that changes to this file are all signed with key
‘3CE464558A84FDC69DB40CFB090B11993D9AEBB5’ (you may need to fetch this
key from a key server, if you have not done it yet).

   From there on, you can authenticate all the commits included in your
checkout by running:

     make authenticate

   The first run takes a couple of minutes, but subsequent runs are
faster.

     注: You are advised to run ‘make authenticate’ after every ‘git
     pull’ invocation.  This ensures you keep receiving valid changes to
     the repository

   设置Guix开发环境的最简单的方式当然是使用Guix！下面这些命令启动一个
shell，所有的依赖和环境变量都为折腾Guix设置好了：

     guix environment guix --pure

   *Note 调用guix environment::, for more information on that command.

   If you are unable to use Guix when building Guix from a checkout, the
following are the required packages in addition to those mentioned in
the installation instructions (*note 需求::).

   • GNU Autoconf (https://gnu.org/software/autoconf/);
   • GNU Automake (https://gnu.org/software/automake/);
   • GNU Gettext (https://gnu.org/software/gettext/);
   • GNU Texinfo (https://gnu.org/software/texinfo/);
   • Graphviz (https://www.graphviz.org/);
   • GNU Help2man (optional) (https://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/).

   On Guix, extra dependencies can be added by instead running ‘guix
environment’ with ‘--ad-hoc’:

     guix environment guix --pure --ad-hoc help2man git strace

   运行 ‘./bootstrap’ 以使用Autoconf和Automake生成构建系统的基础框架。如
果你的得到这样的错误：

     configure.ac:46: error: possibly undefined macro: PKG_CHECK_MODULES

它可能意味着Autoconf无法找到由pkg-config提供的‘pkg.m4’。请确保‘pkg.m4’可
用。由Guile提供的‘guile.m4’宏也类似。假如你的Automake安装在
‘/usr/local’，那么它不会从‘/usr/share’里寻找‘.m4’文件。这种情况下，你必
须执行下面这个命令：

     export ACLOCAL_PATH=/usr/share/aclocal

   参考*Note (automake)Macro Search Path::.

   Then, run ‘./configure’ as usual.  Make sure to pass
‘--localstatedir=DIRECTORY’ where DIRECTORY is the ‘localstatedir’ value
used by your current installation (*note 仓库::, for information about
this).  We recommend to use the value ‘/var’.

   最后，用‘make check’执行测试（*note 运行测试套件::）。如果遇到任何错
误，请参考“安装指导”（*note 安装::）或者给邮件列表 <guix-devel@gnu.org>发
邮件。

=======================

为了保持一个合适的工作环境，你会发现在你的本地代码树里测试修改而不用安装
它们会很有用。TODO: So that you can distinguish between your “end-user”
hat and your “motley” costume.

   To that end, all the command-line tools can be used even if you have
not run ‘make install’.  To do that, you first need to have an
environment with all the dependencies available (*note 从Git构建::), and
then simply prefix each command with ‘./pre-inst-env’ (the
‘pre-inst-env’ script lives in the top build tree of Guix; it is
generated by ‘./configure’).  An example(1):

     $ sudo -E ./pre-inst-env guix-daemon --build-users-group=guixbuild
     $ ./pre-inst-env guix build hello

Similarly, an example for a Guile session using the Guix modules:

     $ ./pre-inst-env guile -c '(use-modules (guix utils)) (pk (%current-system))'

     ;;; ("x86_64-linux")

... and for a REPL (*note (guile)Using Guile Interactively::):

     $ ./pre-inst-env guile
     scheme@(guile-user)> ,use(guix)
     scheme@(guile-user)> ,use(gnu)
     scheme@(guile-user)> (define snakes
                            (fold-packages
                              (lambda (package lst)
                                (if (string-prefix? "python"
                                                    (package-name package))
                                    (cons package lst)
                                    lst))
                              '()))
     scheme@(guile-user)> (length snakes)
     $1 = 361

   ‘pre-inst-env’脚本设置为此好了所有必要的的环境变量，包括‘PATH’和
‘GUILE_LOAD_PATH’。

   ‘./pre-inst-env guix pull’ _不_ 会更新本地源代码树，它只更新符号链接
‘~/.config/guix/current’ (*note 调用guix pull::)。如果你想更新本地源代码
树，请运行‘git pull’。

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The ‘-E’ flag to ‘sudo’ guarantees that ‘GUILE_LOAD_PATH’ is
correctly set such that ‘guix-daemon’ and the tools it uses can find the
Guile modules they need.

14.3 完美的配置
===============

The Perfect Setup to hack on Guix is basically the perfect setup used
for Guile hacking (*note (guile)Using Guile in Emacs::).  First, you
need more than an editor, you need Emacs
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs), empowered by the wonderful Geiser
(https://nongnu.org/geiser/).  To set that up, run:

     guix package -i emacs guile emacs-geiser

   Geiser允许在Emacs里进行交互式的、增长式的开发：buffer里的代码补全和执
行，获取一行的文档（docstrings），上下文敏感的补全，‘M-.’跳转到对象定义
，测试代码的REPL，及更多（*note (geiser)介绍::）。为了方便的Guix开发，请
确保修改Guile的加载路径（load path）以使其能从你的项目里找到源代码文件。

     ;; 假设Guix项目在 ~/src/guix.
     (with-eval-after-load 'geiser-guile
       (add-to-list 'geiser-guile-load-path "~/src/guix"))

   To actually edit the code, Emacs already has a neat Scheme mode.  But
in addition to that, you must not miss Paredit
(https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit).  It provides facilities to
directly operate on the syntax tree, such as raising an s-expression or
wrapping it, swallowing or rejecting the following s-expression, etc.

   We also provide templates for common git commit messages and package
definitions in the ‘etc/snippets’ directory.  These templates can be
used with YASnippet (https://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/) to expand
short trigger strings to interactive text snippets.  You may want to add
the snippets directory to the YAS-SNIPPET-DIRS variable in Emacs.

     ;; 假设Guix项目在 ~/src/guix.
     (with-eval-after-load 'yasnippet
       (add-to-list 'yas-snippet-dirs "~/src/guix/etc/snippets"))

   commit信息片段显示staged文件需要依赖Magit (https://magit.vc/)。编辑
commit信息时，输入‘add’，然后按‘TAB’就可以插入一段用于新增软件包的模板；
输入‘update’，然后按‘TAB’可以插入一段更新软件包的模板；输入‘https’然后按
‘TAB’可以插入一段修改主页URI为HTTPS的模板。

   ‘scheme-mode’最重要的模板可以通过输入‘package...’，然后按‘TAB’触发。
这个片段还插入了触发字符串‘origin...’，以进一步展开。‘origin’片段更进一
步的可能插入其它以‘...’结尾的触发字符串，它们可以被继续展开。

   Additionaly we provide insertion and automatic update of a copyright
in ‘etc/copyright.el’.  You may want to set your full name, mail, and
load a file.

     (setq user-full-name "Alice Doe")
     (setq user-mail-address "alice@mail.org")
     ;; Assuming the Guix checkout is in ~/src/guix.
     (load-file "~/src/guix/etc/copyright.el")

   To insert a copyright at the current line invoke ‘M-x
guix-copyright’.

   To update a copyright you need to specify a ‘copyright-names-regexp’.

     (setq copyright-names-regexp
           (format "%s <%s>" user-full-name user-mail-address))

   You can check if your copyright is up to date by evaluating ‘M-x
copyright-update’.  If you want to do it automatically after each buffer
save then add ‘(add-hook 'after-save-hook 'copyright-update)’ in Emacs.

14.4 打包指导
=============

这个GNU发行版正在开发的早期阶段，可能缺少一些你喜欢的软件。这个章节介绍
你可以怎样帮助这个发行版成长。

   自由软件通常以“源代码包”的形式分发，通常是包含完整代码的‘tar.gz’包。
添加软件包到这个发行版意味着两件事：添加描述如何构建包的“配方”和一系列依
赖软件，以及添加配方之外的“软件包元数据”，如一段文字描述和证书信息。

   在Guix里所有这些信息都包含在“软件包定义”里。软件包定义提供了软件包的
高层视角。它们使用Scheme编程语言编写，事实上，对每个软件包我们都定义一个
绑定到软件包定义的的变量，并且从模块（*note 软件包模块::）中导出那个变量
。然而，深入的Scheme知识_不_是创建软件包的前提条件。若要了解软件包的更多
信息，*note 定义软件包::。

   一旦软件包定义准备好了，并且包存在Guix代码树的一个文件里，你可以用
‘guix build’ (*note 调用guix build::)命令测试它。假设这个新软件包的名字
叫做‘gnew’，你可以在Guix构建树里运行这个命令(*note
在安装之前运行Guix::)：

     ./pre-inst-env guix build gnew --keep-failed

   使用‘--keep-failed’参数会保留失败的构建树，这可以使调试构建错误更容易
。‘--log-file’也是一个调试时很有用的参数，它可以用来访问构建日志。

   如果‘guix’命令找不到这个软件包，那可能是因为源文件包含语法错误，或者
缺少导出软件包的‘define-public’语句。为了查找错误，你可以用Guile导入这个
模块以了解这个错误的详情：

     ./pre-inst-env guile -c '(use-modules (gnu packages gnew))'

   Once your package builds correctly, please send us a patch (*note
提交补丁::).  Well, if you need help, we will be happy to help you too.
Once the patch is committed in the Guix repository, the new package
automatically gets built on the supported platforms by our continuous
integration system (ci.guix.gnu.org).

   用户可以通过运行‘guix pull’命令获取最新的软件包定义（*note 调用guix
pull::）。当‘ci.guix.gnu.org’构建好这些软件包之后，安装这些软件包时会自
动从服务器（*note Substitutes::）上下载构建好的二进制包。唯一需要人工干
预的地方是评审和应用代码补丁。

* Menu:

* 软件自由::             什么可以进入这个发行版。
* 软件包命名::          名字里包含什么？
* 版本号::                当名字不够时
* 简介和描述::          帮助用户寻找合适的软件包

14.4.1 软件自由
---------------

The GNU operating system has been developed so that users can have
freedom in their computing.  GNU is “free software”, meaning that users
have the four essential freedoms
(https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html): to run the program, to
study and change the program in source code form, to redistribute exact
copies, and to distribute modified versions.  Packages found in the GNU
distribution provide only software that conveys these four freedoms.

   In addition, the GNU distribution follow the free software
distribution guidelines
(https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html).
Among other things, these guidelines reject non-free firmware,
recommendations of non-free software, and discuss ways to deal with
trademarks and patents.

   某些上游的软件包源代码包含一小部分违反上述准则的可选的子集，比如这个
子集本身就是非自由代码。这时，这些讨厌的代码需要用合适的补丁或者软件包定
义（*note 定义软件包::）里的‘origin’里的代码片段移除。这样，‘guix build
--source’就可以返回自由的源代码而不是未经修改的上游源代码。


File: guix.zh_CN.info,  Node: 软件包命名,  Next: 版本号,  Prev: 软件自由,  Up: 打包指导

14.4.2 软件包命名
-----------------

一个软件包事实上有两个名字：第一个是_Scheme变量_的名字，即用
‘define-public’定义的名字。通过这个名字，软件包可以被Scheme代码找到，如
用作其它软件包的输入。第二个名字是软件包定义里的‘name’属性的字符串值。这
个名字用于软件包管理命令，如：‘guix package’，‘guix build’

   两个名字通常是相同的，常是上游项目名字转成小写字母并把下划线替换成连
字符的结果。比如，GNUnet转成‘gnunet’，SDL_net转成‘sdl-net’。

   我们不给库软件包添加‘lib’前缀，除非它是项目官方名字的一部分。但是
*note Python模块::和*note Perl模块::有关于Python和Perl语言的特殊规则。

   字体软件包的名字处理起来不同，*note 字体::.


File: guix.zh_CN.info,  Node: 版本号,  Next: 简介和描述,  Prev: 软件包命名,  Up: 打包指导

14.4.3 版本号
-------------

我们通常只为每个自由软件的最新版本打包。但是有时候，比如对于版本不兼容的
库，需要有同一个软件包的两个或更多版本。它们需要使用不同的Scheme变量名。
我们为最新的版本使用*note 软件包命名::里规定的名字，旧的版本使用加上后缀
的名字，后缀是‘-’和可以区分开版本号的版本号的最小前缀。

   软件包定义里的名字对于同一个软件包的所有版本都是相同的，并且不含有版
本号。

   例如，GTK+的2.24.20和3.9.12两个版本可以这样打包：

     (define-public gtk+
       (package
         (name "gtk+")
         (version "3.9.12")
         ...))
     (define-public gtk+-2
       (package
         (name "gtk+")
         (version "2.24.20")
         ...))
   如果我们还需要GTK+ 3.8.2，就这样打包
     (define-public gtk+-3.8
       (package
         (name "gtk+")
         (version "3.8.2")
         ...))

   有时候，我们为软件包上游的版本控制系统（VCS）的快照而不是正式发布版打
包。这是特殊情况，因为决定哪个是稳定版的权力应该属于上游开发者。然而，有
时候这是必须的。那么，我们该如何决定写在‘version’里的版本号呢？

   显然，我们需要让VCS快照的commit ID在版本号中体现出来，但是我们也需要
确保版本号单调递增，以便‘guix package --upgrade’决定哪个版本号更新。由于
commit ID，尤其是Git的commit ID，不是单调递增的，我们添加一个每次升级快
照时都手动增长的revision数字。最后的版本号字符串看起来是这样：

     2.0.11-3.cabba9e
       ^    ^    ^
       |    |    `-- 上游的commit ID
       |    |
       |    `--- Guix软件包的revision
       |
     最新的上游版本号

   It is a good idea to strip commit identifiers in the ‘version’ field
to, say, 7 digits.  It avoids an aesthetic annoyance (assuming
aesthetics have a role to play here) as well as problems related to OS
limits such as the maximum shebang length (127 bytes for the Linux
kernel).  It is best to use the full commit identifiers in ‘origin’s,
though, to avoid ambiguities.  A typical package definition may look
like this:

     (define my-package
       (let ((commit "c3f29bc928d5900971f65965feaae59e1272a3f7")
             (revision "1"))          ;Guix软件包的revision
         (package
           (version (git-version "0.9" revision commit))
           (source (origin
                     (method git-fetch)
                     (uri (git-reference
                           (url "git://example.org/my-package.git")
                           (commit commit)))
                     (sha256 (base32 "1mbikn..."))
                     (file-name (git-file-name name version))))
           ;; ...
           )))

14.4.4 简介和描述
-----------------

我们已经看到，GNU Guix里的每个软件包都包含一个简介（synopsis）和一个描述
（description）（*note 定义软件包::）。简介和描述很重要：它们是‘guix
package --search’搜索的信息，并且是帮助用户决定一个软件包是否符合自己需
求的重要信息。因此，打包的人应该关注怎样写它们的内容。

   简介必须以大写字母开头，并且不能以句号结尾。它们不能以 “a” 或者 “the”
等没有意义的词开头。例如 “File-frobbing tool” 要比 “A tool that frobs
files” 更好。简介需要说明软件包是什么－－如 “Core GNU utilities (file,
text, shell)”，或者它的用途－－如 GNU grep 的简介是 “Print lines
matching a pattern”。

   记住，简介必须能被广大的听众理解。例如，“以SAM格式修改对齐”可能对经验
丰富的生物信息科研工作者来说能理解，但是对普通对听众则是无用的甚至是令人
误解的。简介最好说明软件包应用的领域。在这个例子中，应该这样描述“修改核
苷酸序列的对齐格式”，这会让用户更容易判断这是不是他们想要的。

   描述应该在5至10句话之间。使用完整的句子，并且避免在未介绍的情况下使用
缩写。请避免推广营销性对词汇，如“世界领先”，“行业最强”，“下一代”，并且避
免高级的形容词，如“最先进的”–他们对用户寻找软件包是无用的，甚至是可疑的
。相反的，尽量务实，提及用例和功能。

   描述可以含有Texinfo标记，这对格式化有帮助，如‘@code’、‘@dfn’、列表、
超链接（*note (texinfo)Overview::）。但是，在使用某些字符时应该小心，如
‘@’和花括号是基本的Texinfo特殊字符（*note (texinfo)Special Characters::）
。‘guix package --show’之类的用户界面会解决渲染问题。

   Synopses and descriptions are translated by volunteers at the
Translation Project
(https://translationproject.org/domain/guix-packages.html) so that as
many users as possible can read them in their native language.  User
interfaces search them and display them in the language specified by the
current locale.

   为了让‘xgettext’可以把它们提取成待翻译的字符串，简介和描述_必须是文字
字符串_。这意味着你不能使用‘string-append’或‘format’来合成字符串：

     (package
       ;; ...
       (synopsis "这是可以翻译的")
       (description (string-append "这是" "*不可以*" "翻译的")))

   翻译是很繁重的工作，所以，作为打包者请更加注意你的简介和介绍，每一个
改动都会增加翻译的工作量。为了帮助他们，你可以插入这类可以被他们看到的建
议和指示（*note (gettext)xgettext Invocation::）：

     ;; TRANSLATORS: "X11 resize-and-rotate"不需要翻译。
     (description "ARandR为X11 resize-and-rotate (RandR)扩展提供简单的图形界面。...")

14.4.5 Python模块
-----------------

我们目前为Python 2和Python 3打包，如*note 版本号::的规则所述，它们的
Scheme变量名分别是‘python-2’和‘python’。为了避免和其他编程语言的冲突，
Python模块的软件包名字最好含有‘python’。

   Some modules are compatible with only one version of Python, others
with both.  If the package Foo is compiled with Python 3, we name it
‘python-foo’.  If it is compiled with Python 2, we name it
‘python2-foo’.  Packages should be added when they are necessary; we
don’t add Python 2 variants of the package unless we are going to use
them.

   如果一个项目的名字已经含有‘python’这个单词，我们把它丢掉；例如，
python-dateutil模块打包后的名字是‘python-dateutil’和‘python2-dateutil’。
如果项目的名字以‘py’开头（如 ‘pytz’），我们把它保留，并且添加上面所述的
前缀。

14.4.5.1 指定依赖
.................

Python软件包的依赖信息通常在包的源代码树里，各种文件有不同的精确度：
‘setup.py’文件，‘requirements.txt’文件，‘tox.ini’文件。

   你在写软件包配方时的任务是把这些依赖转换成相应的“输入”（*note inputs:
软件包引用.）。尽管‘pypi’导入工具通常可以做得很好（*note 调用guix
import::），你可能想检查下面这个清单，以决定每个依赖放在哪儿。

   • 默认地，我们为Python 2打包时像Python 3一样安装了‘setuptools’和
     ‘pip’。所以你不需要把它们两个指定为依赖，否则‘guix lint’会警告你。

   • 运行时需要的Python依赖要放进‘propagated-inputs’。它们通常由
     ‘setup.py’文件里的‘install_requires’关键字或‘requirements.txt’文件
     定义。

   • 仅在构建时依赖的Python包–如，‘setup.py’里的‘setup_requires’关键字列
     举的包–或仅在测试时依赖的包–如，‘tests_require’里的包–要放进
     ‘native-inputs’。因为，（1）在运行时不需要它们，因此不需要
     propagate，并且（2）在交叉编译时，它们属于“native”输入。

     例如‘pytest’，‘mock’，‘nose’测试框架。当然，如果在运行时需要这里的
     任何一个包，它需要被加进‘propagated-inputs’。

   • 任何不属于上述类别的包都要被加进‘inputs’，如，构建含有C语言扩展的
     Python包所需的程序和C语言库。

   • 如果一个Python软件包由可选的依赖（‘extras_require’），由你根据它们
     的性价比（用处/负担）决定是否添加它们（*note ‘guix size’:
     提交补丁.）。

14.4.6 Perl模块
---------------

Perl程序和其它软件包的命名规则类似，用小写的上游名字命名。对于仅包含一个
类的Perl包，我们使用小写的类名，把所有的‘::’替换成破折号，并且添加
‘perl-’前缀。所以类‘XML::Parser’变成‘perl-xml-parser’。包含多个类的模块
保留它们上游的名字，并且添加‘perl-’前缀。这类模块的名字通常含有‘perl’，
这个单词需要被删掉。例如，‘libwww-perl’变成‘perl-libwww’。

14.4.7 Java包
-------------

Java程序和其它软件包的命名规则类似，用小写的上游名字命名。

   为了避免和其它编程语言混淆和命名冲突，Java软件包的名字最好有‘java-’前
缀。如果一个项目的名字已经含有‘java’，我们把它删掉；例如，‘ngsjava’打包
后的名字是‘java-ngs’。

   对于仅包含一个或很少几个类的Java软件包，我们使用小写的类名，把所有的
‘.’替换成破折号，并且添加‘java-’前缀。因此，类‘apache.commons.cli’打包后
的名字是‘java-apache-commons-cli’。

14.4.8 Rust Crates
------------------

Rust programs standing for themselves are named as any other package,
using the lowercase upstream name.

   To prevent namespace collisions we prefix all other Rust packages
with the ‘rust-’ prefix.  The name should be changed to lowercase as
appropriate and dashes should remain in place.

   In the rust ecosystem it is common for multiple incompatible versions
of a package to be used at any given time, so all packages should have a
versioned suffix.  If a package has passed version 1.0.0 then just the
major version number is sufficient (e.g. ‘rust-clap-2’), otherwise the
version suffix should contain both the major and minor version (e.g.
‘rust-rand-0.6’).

   Because of the difficulty in reusing rust packages as pre-compiled
inputs for other packages the Cargo build system (*note
‘cargo-build-system’: 构建系统.) presents the ‘#:cargo-inputs’ and
‘cargo-development-inputs’ keywords as build system arguments.  It would
be helpful to think of these as similar to ‘propagated-inputs’ and
‘native-inputs’.  Rust ‘dependencies’ and ‘build-dependencies’ should go
in ‘#:cargo-inputs’, and ‘dev-dependencies’ should go in
‘#:cargo-development-inputs’.  If a Rust package links to other
libraries then the standard placement in ‘inputs’ and the like should be
used.

   Care should be taken to ensure the correct version of dependencies
are used; to this end we try to refrain from skipping the tests or using
‘#:skip-build?’ when possible.  Of course this is not always possible,
as the package may be developed for a different Operating System, depend
on features from the Nightly Rust compiler, or the test suite may have
atrophied since it was released.

14.4.9 字体
-----------

对于通常不会被用户安装用于排版的字体，或者随更大的软件包分发的字体，我们
使用通常的命名规则。例如，这适用于X.Org系统附带的字体或TeX Live附带的字
体。

   为了让用户更容易搜索字体，其它仅含有字体的软件包按以下规则命名，不管
上游的包名是什么。

   仅含有一个字体家族的软件包需要以‘font-’开头；如果作者名字已知，则添加
作者名字和‘-’，接着是字体家族名字（把空格替换成破折号），（和通常一样，
把所有的大写字母转换成小写字母）。例如，由SIL设计的Gentium字体家族打包后
的名字是‘font-sil-gentium’。

   对于一个含有多个字体家族的软件包，用集合的名字替换字体家族的名字。例
如，Liberation字体含有三个家族，Liberation Sans、Liberation Serif和
Liberation Mono。它们可以用‘font-liberation-sans’等名字分开打包；但是由
于它们以一个共同的名字分发，我们倾向于以‘font-liberation’名字统一打包。

   当同一个字体家族或字体集合的不同格式分开打包时，把破折号和格式（缩写
）添加在软件包名字后面。我们用‘-ttf’代表TrueType字体，‘-otf’代表
OpenType字体，‘-type1’代表PostScript Type 1字体。

14.5.3 数据类型和模式匹配
-------------------------

经典的Lisp倾向于用列表表示所有的东西，然后用‘car’，‘cdr’，‘cadr’等手动浏
览它们。这种风格有几个问题，特别是难以阅读，易出错，并且妨碍生成合适的类
型错误报告。

   Guix代码应该定义合适的数据类型（例如，用‘define-record-type*’）而不是
滥用列表。而且，它应该利用Guile的‘(ice-9 match)’模块使用模式匹配，特别是
匹配列表的时候。

(https://mumble.net/~campbell/scheme/style.txt).  This document happens
to describe the conventions mostly used in Guile’s code too.  It is very
thoughtful and well written, so please do read it.

   一些Guix添加的special form，如‘substitute*’宏，有特殊的缩进规则。它们
的规则在‘.dir-locals.el’文件里定义，Emacs会自动使用。另外，Emacs-Guix提
供的‘guix-devel-mode’模式可以正确地缩进和高亮Guix代码（*note
(emacs-guix)开发::）。

   如果你不使用Emacs，请确保让你的编辑器知道这些规则。为了自动地缩进软件
包定义，你也可以运行：

     ./etc/indent-code.el gnu/packages/文件.scm 软件包

这会调用Emacs以批处理模式自动地缩进‘gnu/packages/文件.scm’里软件包的定义
。如果想缩进整个文件，省略第二个参数：

     ./etc/indent-code.el gnu/services/文件.scm

   如果你用Vim编辑代码，我们推荐你运行‘:set autoindent’，以使你在输入时
自动缩进代码。另外，‘paredit.vim’
(https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3998)可以帮你处理括号
。

   我们要求所有的顶级过程附带一个docstring。这个要求对‘(guix build
...)’命名空间里的简单的私有过程可以放宽。

   过程不应该有多于四个定位参数。对于接收多于四个定位参数的过程应使用关
键字参数。

14.6 提交补丁
=============

Development is done using the Git distributed version control system.
Thus, access to the repository is not strictly necessary.  We welcome
contributions in the form of patches as produced by ‘git format-patch’
sent to the <guix-patches@gnu.org> mailing list.  Seasoned Guix
developers may also want to look at the section on commit access (*note
Commit Access::).

   This mailing list is backed by a Debbugs instance, which allows us to
keep track of submissions (*note Tracking Bugs and Patches::).  Each
message sent to that mailing list gets a new tracking number assigned;
people can then follow up on the submission by sending email to
‘NNN@debbugs.gnu.org’, where NNN is the tracking number (*note
发送补丁系列::).

   请以ChangeLog格式（*note (standards)Change Logs::）写commit日志；你可
以浏览commit历史里的例子。

   提交添加或者修改软件包定义的补丁之前，请过一遍这个检查列表：

  1. 如果软件包的作者为发布的文件包提供了密码学签名，请验证文件的真实性
     。对于独立的GPG签名文件，这可以通过‘gpg --verify’命令完成：

  2. 花些时间为软件包提供一个合适的简介和描述。更多指导，*Note
     简介和描述::。

  3. 运行‘guix lint 软件包’，软件包是新添加的或修改过的软件包的名字，修
     复它报告的错误（*note 调用guix lint::）。

  4. 用‘guix build 软件包’命令确保这个软件包可以在你的平台上构建。

  5. 我们建议你同时尝试在别的支持的平台上构建这个软件包。你可能没有别的
     平台的真实的硬件，我们推荐使用‘qemu-binfmt-service-type’来模拟它们
     。为了启用这个功能，把下面这个服务添加到你的‘操作系统’配置的服务列
     表里：

          (service qemu-binfmt-service-type
           (qemu-binfmt-configuration
             (platforms (lookup-qemu-platforms "arm" "aarch64"))
             (guix-support? #t)))

     然后重新配置你的系统。

     你之后可以用‘--system’参数为不同的平台构建软件包。例如，为armhf，
     aarch64，或mips64架构构建"hello"软件包，你可以依次运行如下的命令：
          guix build --system=armhf-linux --rounds=2 hello
          guix build --system=aarch64-linux --rounds=2 hello

  6. 请确保软件包里不捆绑出现已经被打过包的软件的副本。

     有时，软件包为了方便用户，捆绑了依赖库的源代码。然而，当依赖库在发
     行版里已经存在时，做为一个发行版，我们希望确保这些软件包使用发行版
     里已有的副本。这提高资源使用率（依赖库只构建一次，存储一份），并且
     使发行版更容易管理，如仅在一个地方对某个软件包进行安全更新就可以影
     响整个系统－－捆绑软件会妨碍这么做。

  7. 看一下‘guix size’（*note 调用guix size::）的分析报告。这会让你注意
     到对其它软件包无意中的引用。它也可以帮助决定是否要把一个软件包分割
     成几个输出（*note 有多个输出的软件包::），以及需要使用哪些可选的依
     赖。特别地，避免把‘texlive’添加为依赖：因为它太大了，请使用
     ‘texlive-tiny’或‘texlive-union’代替它。

  8. 对于重要的更改，确保依赖它的软件包没有受到影响。‘guix refresh
     --list-dependent 软件包’会帮你检查（*note 调用guix refresh::）。

     取决于受影响的软件包的数量，即需要重新构建的数量，commit需要被提交
     到不同的分支，具体如下：

     300个或更少的受影响的软件包
          ‘master’分支（非破坏性的更改）。

     300至1200个受影响的软件包
          ‘staging’分支（非破坏性的更改）。这个分支每隔大约3周会被合并进
          ‘master’。对某个主题的更改（如对GNOME系列的更新）可以放进一个
          特定的分支（如‘gnome-updates’）。

     超过1200个受影响的软件包
          ‘core-updates’分支（可能含有重要的或破坏性的更改）。这个分支每
          隔大约2.5个月会被合并进‘master’。

     All these branches are tracked by our build farm (ci.guix.gnu.org)
     and merged into ‘master’ once everything has been successfully
     built.  This allows us to fix issues before they hit users, and to
     reduce the window during which pre-built binaries are not
     available.

     通常，‘master’之外的其它分支如果最近被评审过，或有一个对应的
     ‘-next’分支，则被视为_冻结_状态。如果不清楚该把补丁放到哪里，请在邮
     件列表或IRC上提问。

  9. 检查软件包的构建过程是不是确定性的。这通常意味着检查对软件包的独立
     构建是否能得到每一个比特都完全相同的结果。

     为此，一个简单的做法是在你的机器上多次构建同一个软件包（*note
     调用guix build::）：

          guix build --rounds=2 <我的软件包>

     这足以查出一批普通的不确定性问题，如构建结果里存在时间戳或随机生成
     的输出。

     另一个选择是使用‘guix challenge’（*note 调用guix challenge::）。当
     软件包被提交并且被‘ci.guix.gnu.org’构建之后，你可以运行这个命令检查
     你是否得到相同的构建结果。更好的：找另一台可以构建的机器，运行‘guix
     publish’。由于远程的构建机器很可能和你的机器不同，这可以捕捉到由硬
     件不同引起的不确定性问题－－如，使用不同的指令集－－或不同操作系统
     内核引起的问题－－如，对‘uname’或‘/proc’文件的依赖。

  10. 在编写文档时，请用性别中立的词语指代人，如“他”, “他的”
     (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they)，等。

  11. 检查你的补丁只包含一些相关的更改。把不相关的更改捆绑在一起会让评审
     更困难和更慢。

     不相关的更改的例子有：同时新增多个软件包，或更新软件包同时修补这个
     软件包。

  12. 请遵守我们的代码格式规范，最好运行‘etc/indent-code.el’脚本以自动为
     你格式化（*note 格式化代码::）。

  13. 当可能时，请在源URL里使用镜像*note 调用guix download::。使用可靠的
     而不是生成的URL。例如，GitHub的下载文件每次生成时不一定是相同的，所
     以这时最好克隆仓库。不要在URL里使用‘name’变量：这没有什么用，而且如
     果名字变了，URL很可能就错了。

  14. Check if Guix builds (*note 从Git构建::) and address the warnings,
     especially those about use of undefined symbols.

  15. Make sure your changes do not break Guix and simulate a ‘guix
     pull’ with:
          guix pull --url=/path/to/your/checkout --profile=/tmp/guix.master

   When posting a patch to the mailing list, use ‘[PATCH] ...’ as a
subject, if your patch is to be applied on a branch other than ‘master’,
say ‘core-updates’, specify it in the subject like ‘[PATCH core-updates]
...’.  You may use your email client or the ‘git send-email’ command
(*note 发送补丁系列::).  We prefer to get patches in plain text
messages, either inline or as MIME attachments.  You are advised to pay
attention if your email client changes anything like line breaks or
indentation which could potentially break the patches.

   当一个bug被修复时，请通过向<NNN-done@debbugs.gnu.org>发邮件的方式关闭
thread。

发送补丁系列
------------

When sending a patch series (e.g., using ‘git send-email’), please first
send one message to <guix-patches@gnu.org>, and then send subsequent
patches to <NNN@debbugs.gnu.org> to make sure they are kept together.
See the Debbugs documentation (https://debbugs.gnu.org/Advanced.html)
for more information.  You can install ‘git send-email’ with ‘guix
install git:send-email’.

14.7 Tracking Bugs and Patches
==============================

Bug reports and patch submissions are currently tracked using the
Debbugs instance at <https://bugs.gnu.org>.  Bug reports are filed
against the ‘guix’ “package” (in Debbugs parlance), by sending email to
<bug-guix@gnu.org>, while patch submissions are filed against the
‘guix-patches’ package by sending email to <guix-patches@gnu.org> (*note
提交补丁::).

   A web interface (actually _two_ web interfaces!)  are available to
browse issues:

   • <https://bugs.gnu.org/guix> lists bug reports;
   • <https://bugs.gnu.org/guix-patches> lists patch submissions.

   You can also access both of these via the (nicer)
<https://issues.guix.gnu.org> interface(1).  To view discussions related
to issue number N, go to ‘https://issues.guix.gnu.org/issue/N’ or
‘https://bugs.gnu.org/N’.

   If you use Emacs, you may find it more convenient to interact with
issues using ‘debbugs.el’, which you can install with:

     guix install emacs-debbugs

   For example, to list all open issues on ‘guix-patches’, hit:

     C-u M-x debbugs-gnu RET RET guix-patches RET n y

   *Note (debbugs-ug)Top::, for more information on this nifty tool!

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The web interface at <https://issues.guix.gnu.org> is powered by
Mumi, a nice piece of software written in Guile, and you can help!  See
<https://git.elephly.net/gitweb.cgi?p=software/mumi.git>.


File: guix.zh_CN.info,  Node: Commit Access,  Prev: Tracking Bugs and Patches,  Up: 贡献

14.8 Commit Access
==================

For frequent contributors, having write access to the repository is
convenient.  When you deem it necessary, consider applying for commit
access by following these steps:

  1. Find three committers who would vouch for you.  You can view the
     list of committers at
     <https://savannah.gnu.org/project/memberlist.php?group=guix>.  Each
     of them should email a statement to <guix-maintainers@gnu.org> (a
     private alias for the collective of maintainers), signed with their
     OpenPGP key.

     Committers are expected to have had some interactions with you as a
     contributor and to be able to judge whether you are sufficiently
     familiar with the project’s practices.  It is _not_ a judgment on
     the value of your work, so a refusal should rather be interpreted
     as “let’s try again later”.

  2. Send <guix-maintainers@gnu.org> a message stating your intent,
     listing the three committers who support your application, signed
     with the OpenPGP key you will use to sign commits, and giving its
     fingerprint (see below).  See
     <https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/>, for an introduction to
     public-key cryptography with GnuPG.

     Set up GnuPG such that it never uses the SHA1 hash algorithm for
     digital signatures, which is known to be unsafe since 2019, for
     instance by adding the following line to ‘~/.gnupg/gpg.conf’ (*note
     (gnupg)GPG Esoteric Options::):

          digest-algo sha512

  3. Maintainers ultimately decide whether to grant you commit access,
     usually following your referrals’ recommendation.

  4. If and once you’ve been given access, please send a message to
     <guix-devel@gnu.org> to say so, again signed with the OpenPGP key
     you will use to sign commits (do that before pushing your first
     commit).  That way, everyone can notice and ensure you control that
     OpenPGP key.

          Important: Before you can push for the first time, maintainers
          must:

            1. add your OpenPGP key to the ‘keyring’ branch;
            2. add your OpenPGP fingerprint to the
               ‘.guix-authorizations’ file of the branch(es) you will
               commit to.

  5. Make sure to read the rest of this section and...  profit!

     注: Maintainers are happy to give commit access to people who have
     been contributing for some time and have a track record—don’t be
     shy and don’t underestimate your work!

     However, note that the project is working towards a more automated
     patch review and merging system, which, as a consequence, may lead
     us to have fewer people with commit access to the main repository.
     Stay tuned!

   If you get commit access, please make sure to follow the policy below
(discussions of the policy can take place on <guix-devel@gnu.org>).

   Non-trivial patches should always be posted to <guix-patches@gnu.org>
(trivial patches include fixing typos, etc.).  This mailing list fills
the patch-tracking database (*note Tracking Bugs and Patches::).

   For patches that just add a new package, and a simple one, it’s OK to
commit, if you’re confident (which means you successfully built it in a
chroot setup, and have done a reasonable copyright and license
auditing).  Likewise for package upgrades, except upgrades that trigger
a lot of rebuilds (for example, upgrading GnuTLS or GLib).  We have a
mailing list for commit notifications (<guix-commits@gnu.org>), so
people can notice.  Before pushing your changes, make sure to run ‘git
pull --rebase’.

   All commits that are pushed to the central repository on Savannah
must be signed with an OpenPGP key, and the public key should be
uploaded to your user account on Savannah and to public key servers,
such as ‘keys.openpgp.org’.  To configure Git to automatically sign
commits, run:

     git config commit.gpgsign true
     git config user.signingkey CABBA6EA1DC0FF33

   You can prevent yourself from accidentally pushing unsigned commits
to Savannah by using the pre-push Git hook called located at
‘etc/git/pre-push’:

     cp etc/git/pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push

   When pushing a commit on behalf of somebody else, please add a
‘Signed-off-by’ line at the end of the commit log message—e.g., with
‘git am --signoff’.  This improves tracking of who did what.

   When adding channel news entries (*note Writing Channel News: 通道.),
make sure they are well-formed by running the following command right
before pushing:

     make check-channel-news

   For anything else, please post to <guix-patches@gnu.org> and leave
time for a review, without committing anything (*note 提交补丁::).  If
you didn’t receive any reply after two weeks, and if you’re confident,
it’s OK to commit.

   That last part is subject to being adjusted, allowing individuals to
commit directly on non-controversial changes on parts they’re familiar
with.

   One last thing: the project keeps moving forward because committers
not only push their own awesome changes, but also offer some of their
time _reviewing_ and pushing other people’s changes.  As a committer,
you’re welcome to use your expertise and commit rights to help other
contributors, too!

Guix is based on the Nix package manager (https://nixos.org/nix/), which
was designed and implemented by Eelco Dolstra, with contributions from
other people (see the ‘nix/AUTHORS’ file in Guix).  Nix pioneered
functional package management, and promoted unprecedented features, such
as transactional package upgrades and rollbacks, per-user profiles, and
referentially transparent build processes.  Without this work, Guix
would not exist.

   The Nix-based software distributions, Nixpkgs and NixOS, have also
been an inspiration for Guix.

   GNU Guix itself is a collective work with contributions from a number
of people.  See the ‘AUTHORS’ file in Guix for more information on these
fine people.  The ‘THANKS’ file lists people who have helped by
reporting bugs, taking care of the infrastructure, providing artwork and
themes, making suggestions, and more—thank you!

Appendix A GNU自由文档许可证
****************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
