     "GNU less is a pager, a program that allows you to view large amounts
of text in page-sized chunks.  Unlike traditional pagers, it allows both
backwards and forwards movement through the document.  It also does not have
to read the entire input file before starting, so it starts faster than most
text editors.")

enhanced by external filters to become more powerful.  The input filter for
less described here is called @code{lesspipe.sh}.  It is able to process a
wide variety of file formats.  It enables users to inspect archives and
display their contents without having to unpack them before.  The filter is
easily extensible for new formats.")
